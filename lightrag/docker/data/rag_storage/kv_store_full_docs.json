They independently verify the integrity of bitcoins to prevent counterfeiting, debasement, and other issues. This verification is crucial because people only accept money if they believe it will retain value for future spending.\n\nBitcoin Core is the reference implementation used by most full node operators since the network's beginning. It allows users to examine blocks, transactions, and other blockchain data that their node has autonomously verified without relying on any central authority. Running your own node gives you authoritative information about Bitcoin's state not because some entity designates it as such, but because your node independently verifies everything.",

This original software evolved into what is now called Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from other implementations. As an open source project under the MIT license, Bitcoin's code is freely available to download and use for any purpose.\n\nThe Bitcoin Core project has grown substantially since its inception. By 2023, it had over 1,000 contributors, with around a dozen developers working nearly full-time and several dozen more contributing part-time. Bitcoin Core implements all aspects of the technology, including wallets, transaction and block validation, block construction tools, and all modern peer-to-peer communication protocols.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core serves as the reference implementation, many system aspects introduced after 2011 are documented in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). These specifications provide standardized documentation for major upgrades and technical implementations that extend beyond the original whitepaper.",

You can view available options with `./configure --help`. Common configuration options include:\n\n- `--prefix=$HOME`: Install in your home directory instead of system-wide\n- `--disable-wallet`: Skip the wallet implementation\n- `--with-incompatible-bdb`: Allow incompatible Berkeley DB versions for wallets\n- `--with-gui=no`: Build only the command-line tools without the GUI\n\nAfter configuration, compile the code using `make`, verify with `make check`, and install with `make install`:\n\n```\n$ make\n$ make check\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\nThe default installation puts executables in `/usr/local/bin`, which you can verify with:\n\n```\n$ which bitcoind\n/usr/local/bin/bitcoind\n```",

It uses mathematical functions that are easy to calculate in one direction but infeasible to reverse. Bitcoin specifically uses elliptic curve multiplication, where a private key (k) is multiplied by a generator point (G) to produce a public key (K). This relationship can be expressed as K = k × G.\n\nThe private key is a randomly generated number between 0 and n-1, where n is the order of the elliptic curve (approximately 1.1578 × 10^77^). This number must be kept secret as it grants control over bitcoins. The public key is derived from the private key and can be shared with others to receive funds. When transactions are created, the private key generates signatures that can be verified against the public key without revealing the private key itself.\n\nBitcoin uses the secp256k1 curve, defined by y² = (x³ + 7) mod p, where p is a large prime number (2^256^ – 2^32^ – 2^9^ – 2^8^ – 2^7^ – 2^6^ – 2^4^ – 1).

This allows Bitcoin to create secure commitments to public keys without revealing them until spending.\n\nBitcoin commonly uses SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 hash functions. To create commitments to public keys, Bitcoin applies SHA256 followed by RIPEMD-160 (known as HASH160), producing a 20-byte result instead of the 65-byte public key:\n\n```\nA = RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))\n```\n\nThis hash can be used in Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) scripts:\n```\nOutput script: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <Bob's key hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\nInput script: <Bob's signature> <Bob's public key>\n```\n\nWhen executed, this script duplicates the public key, hashes it, and verifies it matches the commitment from the output script before checking the signature.

Base58 is similar to Base64 but omits easily confused characters (0, O, l, I) and symbols (+, /). The Base58 alphabet consists of:\n```\n123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz\n```\n\nBase58Check adds a version prefix and checksum to the data being encoded:\n1. Add a version prefix byte (e.g., 0x00 for P2PKH addresses)\n2. Calculate a \"double-SHA\" checksum: `checksum = SHA256(SHA256(prefix||data))`\n3. Take the first 4 bytes of this checksum and append them to the data\n4. Encode the result (prefix + data + checksum) using Base58\n\nThis process creates addresses that are:\n- Compact and easy to share\n- Error-detecting (mistakes in transcription are almost always caught)\n- Format-specific (different prefixes create visually distinguishable formats)\n\nFor example, P2PKH addresses begin with \"1\" (e.g., 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa), while P2SH addresses begin with \"3\". This encoding became the standard for Bitcoin addresses until the introduction of more advanced formats.",

Since an elliptic curve is symmetrical around the x-axis, a public key's y-coordinate can be derived from its x-coordinate and a single bit indicating whether y is even or odd. This allows public keys to be represented in just 33 bytes instead of 65 bytes.\n\nAn uncompressed public key begins with the prefix 0x04 followed by the x and y coordinates:\n```\nK = 04F028892BAD7ED57D2FB57BF33081D5CFCF6F9ED3D3D7F159C2E2FFF579DC341A07CF33DA18BD734C600B96A72BBC4749D5141C90EC8AC328AE52DDFE2E505BDB\n```\n\nA compressed public key uses prefix 0x02 if y is even or 0x03 if y is odd, followed by just the x-coordinate:\n```\nK = 03F028892BAD7ED57D2FB57BF33081D5CFCF6F9ED3D3D7F159C2E2FFF579DC341A\n```\n\nBoth forms represent the same public key, but using compressed keys results in smaller transactions, allowing more payments per block. Compressed public keys became the standard in Bitcoin and are required for certain protocol features. However, they produce different address hashes than uncompressed keys, so a single private key can generate two different Bitcoin addresses depending on which public key format is used.",

Rather than putting complex conditions in the output script, P2SH places a commitment (hash) to a redemption script.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n1. The receiver creates a redemption script with desired spending conditions (e.g., requiring multiple signatures)\n2. This script is hashed using HASH160: `commitment = RIPEMD160(SHA256(script))`\n3. The output script follows a simple template: `OP_HASH160 <commitment> OP_EQUAL`\n4. When spending, the input script includes the full redemption script plus data to satisfy it: `<data> <redemption script>`\n\nFor example, to create a 2-of-2 multisignature requirement:\n```\nRedemption script: <public key 1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <public key 2> OP_CHECKSIG\nOutput script: OP_HASH160 <hash of redemption script> OP_EQUAL\nInput script: <signature2> <signature1> <redemption script>\n```\n\nP2SH addresses use Base58Check encoding with version prefix 0x05, resulting in addresses that start with \"3\". This innovation allowed complex scripts to be used without burdening senders with their complexity, enabling advanced features like multisignature setups.\n\nHowever, P2SH has a security limitation: it's vulnerable to collision attacks when multiple parties construct the redemption script, offering only 80 bits of collision resistance in these scenarios instead of the expected 160 bits.",

To counter this risk, HD wallets provide hardened derivation, which breaks the relationship between parent public key and child chain code.\n\nHardened derivation uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" that prevents compromise of parent or sibling keys. Index numbers for hardened derivation range from 2^31 to 2^32-1 and are displayed with a prime symbol (e.g., 0').\n\nAs a best practice, level-1 children of master keys are always derived through hardened derivation to prevent compromise of master keys.

This separation is powerful for security - the frontend wallet can distribute public keys without ever needing access to private keys, while a more secure hardware signing device can hold the private keys safely offline.\n\nThis arrangement is commonly used for hardware signing devices and provides a clear security boundary between the frontend wallet application (which distributes public keys) and the signing operations (which require private keys).",

The generation process has two main parts:\n\n**Generating a recovery code:**\n1. Create a random sequence (entropy) of 128 to 256 bits\n2. Create a checksum of the random sequence by taking the first few bits of its SHA256 hash\n3. Add the checksum to the end of the random sequence\n4. Split the result into 11-bit segments\n5. Map each 11-bit value to a word from a predefined dictionary of 2,048 words\n6. The resulting sequence of words is the recovery code\n\n**From recovery code to seed:**\n7. The recovery code from step 6 represents the entropy\n8. This entropy is put through PBKDF2 key-stretching with the salt \"mnemonic\" plus an optional passphrase\n9. PBKDF2 stretches the recovery code using 2,048 rounds of HMAC-SHA512 hashing, producing a 512-bit seed\n\nThe relationship between entropy size and recovery code length is:\n- 128 bits entropy → 12 words\n- 160 bits entropy → 15 words\n- 192 bits entropy → 18 words\n- 224 bits entropy → 21 words\n- 256 bits entropy → 24 words\n\nMost modern wallets use 128 bits of entropy for their recovery codes, which provides sufficient security for Bitcoin applications.",

The resulting 512-bit hash is split in half. The right half becomes the child chain code, while the left half is added to the parent private key to produce the child private key.\n\nChild private keys are indistinguishable from random keys and can be used to make public keys and Bitcoin addresses. The child key derivation process can be repeated to create grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on to arbitrary depth.\n\nPublic child key derivation allows deriving child public keys directly from parent public keys without knowing the private keys. This enables useful security arrangements where a server can generate new addresses without having any private keys. The mechanism is similar to private key derivation but uses the parent public key as input.\n\nAn important consideration when using extended public keys is the \"gap limit\" - the maximum number of unused keys in a row a wallet will scan before stopping. If all keys up to the gap limit remain unused, the wallet must either refuse new requests, generate keys beyond the gap limit (risking recovery issues), or reuse previously distributed keys (compromising privacy).",

This version adds additional constraints on the sequence field, but only for version 2 or higher transactions. Version 1 transactions remain unaffected by these new rules. BIP112, which was part of the same soft fork as BIP68, upgraded the OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY opcode to fail if used in a transaction with a version less than 2.\n\nVersion numbers are important for protecting presigned transactions. When someone signs a transaction without broadcasting it immediately (as happens in protocols like Lightning Network), they rely on that transaction being valid when it's eventually broadcast.

Scriptless multisignatures offer an alternative approach.\n\nIn scriptless multisignatures, participants each create partial private keys and derive partial public keys. These public keys are combined to create a multisignature public key that looks identical to any regular Bitcoin public key. Similarly, participants generate partial signatures that are combined into a single signature.\n\nThe benefits include:\n- Constant transaction size regardless of the number of participants\n- Complete privacy - third parties can't tell if a signature came from one person or many\n- Identical appearance to single-signature transactions\n\nPay to Contract (P2C) is another powerful technique where a public key is tweaked with a commitment to a contract or description. The sender adds the hash of the contract to the recipient's public key and pays to the resulting key. The recipient can spend by tweaking their private key with the same value.\n\nThis allows the sender to later prove what they paid for by revealing the original key and the contract description, while maintaining complete privacy unless the parties choose to reveal the details.",

This prevents potential denial-of-service attacks through infinite loops. Script is also stateless, meaning there's no state before or after execution, and all necessary information is contained within the script itself. This ensures predictable execution across all nodes in the network.\n\nWhen validating a transaction, each input in a transaction is validated separately. The validation process copies the input script, retrieves the UTXO referenced by the input, and copies the output script from that UTXO. Both scripts are then executed together, with the input script needing to satisfy the output script's conditions for the transaction to be valid.",

Bitcoin currently supports two signature algorithms: the Schnorr signature algorithm and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA).\n\nThese signature algorithms are used in various contexts within Bitcoin, including spending segwit v0 P2WPKH outputs, segwit v1 P2TR keypath spending, and in script functions like OP_CHECKSIG, OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY, OP_CHECKMULTISIG, OP_CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY, and OP_CHECKSIGADD.

If the same k is used to sign different transactions, the private key can be calculated by anyone, potentially leading to theft of funds.\n\nThis vulnerability has resulted in actual thefts in Bitcoin's history due to improperly initialized random-number generators. To mitigate this risk, the industry best practice is to deterministically derive k using both the transaction data and the private key, ensuring each transaction produces a different k value.\n\nFor ECDSA, RFC6979 defines the standard algorithm for deterministic initialization of k. For Schnorr signatures, BIP340 recommends a default signing algorithm.

In this scheme, multiple parties can cooperate to create a single signature that proves they collectively know the sum of their private keys, without revealing individual private keys.\n\nThe basic protocol works as follows:\n\n1. Participants Alice and Bob each have private keys y and z, respectively\n2. They derive public keys yG and zG, then combine them to create an aggregated public key xG = yG + zG\n3. Each chooses a private nonce (a for Alice, b for Bob) and derives public nonces aG and bG\n4. They produce an aggregated public nonce kG = aG + bG\n5. They generate a challenge scalar e = hash(kG || xG || m)\n6. Alice computes q = a + ey and Bob computes r = b + ez\n7. They combine these to form s = q + r\n8. The final signature is (kG, s)\n\nHowever, this basic protocol is vulnerable to key cancellation attacks, where one party might learn another's public key before committing to their own, potentially allowing them to create a valid signature without the other's participation. Various security measures, like commitment schemes, have been developed to address this issue.\n\nThe MuSig family of protocols offers secure implementations:\n- MuSig (MuSig1): Simple but requires three rounds of communication\n- MuSig2 (BIP327): Requires only two rounds of communication, more efficient\n- MuSig-DN: Uses deterministic nonces to eliminate repeated session attacks",

However, she can create another signature for a transaction paying someone else using the same output (bitcoins) she used to pay Bob. These are called \"conflicting transactions\" because only one can be included in the valid blockchain.\n\nTo protect against conflicting transactions, Bob should wait until Alice's transaction is confirmed in the blockchain to a sufficient depth. For a transaction to be confirmed, it must be included in a block. Miners select which transactions to include in blocks, and typically select transactions that maximize their revenue.

For example, instead of mining block #100,001, miners might attempt to remine block #100,000 but include high-fee transactions from the current mempool.\n\nCurrently, this attack isn't very lucrative because block subsidies are much higher than total fees per block. However, as transaction fees eventually become the majority of miner rewards, this scenario becomes more likely.\n\nSeveral wallets discourage fee sniping by creating transactions with a lock time that limits them to being included only in the next block or later blocks. In our example, a wallet would set lock time to 100,001. This prevents miners from including these transactions in remined blocks, making fee sniping less profitable.\n\nThis approach doesn't entirely prevent fee sniping but helps preserve network stability as block subsidies decline. It's recommended that wallets implement anti-fee sniping measures when they don't interfere with other uses of the lock time field.",

Unlike other payment systems where fees might be hidden, Bitcoin transaction fees require explicit permission from the spender. While it's possible for a receiver to pay a fee in a separate transaction, it's most efficient for the spender to pay the fee in the same transaction that makes the payment. This approach accommodates the technical structure of Bitcoin and matches practical expectations, as spenders often have the highest desire to see transactions confirm quickly.\n\nMiners evaluate transactions by dividing the fee by the transaction's size (weight) to find the highest fee per weight, called the \"fee rate.\" This is analogous to comparison shopping by price per unit. Fee rates can be expressed in different units:\n- BTC/Bytes or BTC/Kilobytes (legacy units)\n- BTC/Vbytes or BTC/Kilo-vbyte\n- Satoshi/Vbyte (most common today)\n- Satoshi/Weight (also common)\n\nIt's crucial to be careful when accepting fee rate inputs.

    "content": "## Replace By Fee (RBF) Fee Bumping\n\nRBF fee bumping involves creating a conflicting version of a transaction that pays a higher fee. Transactions conflict when they each try to spend one of the same UTXOs. To prevent network abuse through excessive transaction creation, Bitcoin Core and other nodes that support transaction replacement require each replacement transaction to pay a higher fee rate than the transaction being replaced.\n\nBitcoin Core supports two variations of RBF:\n- **Opt-in RBF**: Transactions can signal that they allow replacement with higher fee rate versions. This is specified in BIP125 and enabled by default in Bitcoin Core.\n- **Full RBF**: Any unconfirmed transaction can be replaced with a higher fee rate version. This is optionally available in Bitcoin Core but disabled by default.\n\nThe existence of two variants stems from controversy around transaction replacement. Some merchants relied on the assumption that valid unconfirmed transactions would eventually confirm. Transaction replacement breaks this assumption since an alternative version might not pay the same outputs. As a compromise, Bitcoin Core implemented opt-in RBF, where only transactions signaling replacement permission could be replaced.\n\nWhen implementing RBF fee bumping, a wallet creates a new transaction that spends at least one of the same UTXOs as the original transaction, usually keeping the same outputs that pay the receiver(s). The increased fee can be paid by reducing the change output value or adding additional inputs to the transaction.\n\nThe advantage of RBF is its efficiency in using block space. The disadvantage is that normally only the transaction creator can perform RBF fee bumping, with limited exceptions for specially designed transactions.",

Since miners must confirm the parent transaction to include the child transaction, they will evaluate the profitability of confirming both transactions together as a package.\n\nTo evaluate package profitability, miners calculate the \"package fee rate\" by dividing the aggregate fees of all transactions in the package by their aggregate size. Miners sort all individual transactions and packages by fee rate and include the highest-revenue ones in their blocks. This process, called \"ancestor fee rate mining,\" has been implemented in Bitcoin Core for years and is used by most miners.\n\nCPFP has several advantages over RBF. Any recipient of a transaction output can use CPFP, including both payment recipients and the spender (if they included a change output). It also doesn't replace the original transaction, making it less disruptive to merchants than RBF.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of CPFP is that it typically uses more block space.

Later versions limited mempool size to store only the highest fee rate transactions or packages. This creates a dependency problem for CPFP: to calculate a package fee rate, nodes need both parent and child transactions, but if the parent doesn't pay a high enough fee rate, it won't be kept in the mempool.\n\nPackage relay solves this by allowing transactions to be relayed as a package, enabling receiving nodes to evaluate the fee rate of the entire package before acting on individual transactions. As of writing, significant progress has been made on implementing package relay in Bitcoin Core.\n\nThis feature is especially important for protocols based on time-sensitive presigned transactions, such as Lightning Network. In non-cooperative scenarios, some transactions can't be fee bumped using RBF and must rely on CPFP. If a presigned transaction pays too low a fee rate to enter the mempool, there's no way to fee bump it with a child transaction. Package relay solves this critical problem.",

This is called \"transaction pinning.\"\n\nIn the context of RBF, Bitcoin Core accepts replacement transactions only if they pay more fees than all transactions that will be forgotten (the original plus descendants). This means if Alice creates a small transaction paying Bob, and Bob creates a large child transaction, Alice would need to pay a fee larger than what both she and Bob originally paid to replace her transaction.\n\nFor CPFP, Bitcoin Core limits a parent transaction to having a maximum of 25 ancestors or descendants in its mempool and limits the total size of all those transactions to 100,000 vbytes. This prevents users from creating CPFP fee bumps if a transaction already has too many descendants.\n\nTransaction pinning can happen accidentally, but it also represents a serious vulnerability for multiparty time-sensitive protocols like Lightning Network. If a counterparty can prevent transaction confirmation by a deadline, they might be able to steal funds.

These transactions might need to be broadcast at unknown future times, making fee rate estimation impossible. Both RBF and CPFP are vulnerable to transaction pinning, which could allow malicious parties to steal funds.\n\nThe solution was \"CPFP carve out\": an exception to CPFP rules allowing a single additional transaction up to 1,000 vbytes to be added to a package even if it exceeds normal limits, as long as it's a direct child of an unconfirmed transaction with no unconfirmed ancestors.\n\nFor example, Bob and Mallory co-sign a transaction with outputs to each of them. If Mallory broadcasts the transaction and attaches many child transactions to her output, normally Bob would be unable to attach a child transaction for CPFP fee bumping. With carve-out, he can spend his output as long as his child transaction is less than 1,000 vbytes.\n\nCPFP carve-out works only once, making it suitable only for two-party protocols.

This helps nodes track transactions known to the network but not yet included in the blockchain. As transactions are verified, they're added to the mempool and relayed to neighboring nodes.\n\nSome implementations also maintain a separate orphan pool for transactions whose inputs reference transactions that aren't yet known. When a parent transaction arrives, its child transactions can be validated and moved from the orphan pool to the mempool, potentially triggering a cascade of validations for interdependent transactions.\n\nMany Bitcoin implementations also maintain a UTXO database containing all unspent outputs on the blockchain. Unlike the mempool and orphan pools (which represent a node's local perspective and may vary between nodes), the UTXO database represents the network's emergent consensus and should be consistent across nodes. This database is stored on persistent storage and contains millions of entries dating back to the genesis block.",

Other miners need to receive this block quickly to avoid working on outdated chains, which could lead to block-finding races. These races disadvantage smaller miners and work against Bitcoin's decentralization goals.\n\nIn 2015, Bitcoin Core introduced compact block relay (BIP152) to accelerate block propagation and reduce bandwidth usage. This feature allows nodes to transmit only the information that receiving nodes don't already have. Since full nodes that relay unconfirmed transactions store many of these in their mempools, compact blocks send 6-byte identifiers for transactions instead of full transaction data. The receiving node can check if it already has these transactions in its mempool and only request the missing ones.\n\nBitcoin Core implements two modes of compact block relay:\n\n* **Low-bandwidth mode**: The peer sends only the block header hash without details, saving bandwidth when the receiving node might get the block from another source.\n* **High-bandwidth mode**: The peer sends the compact block before full verification, only ensuring the proof of work is correct. This minimizes propagation delays at each hop.\n\nWhile the names might be confusing, both modes significantly reduce bandwidth compared to pre-compact block methods.",

Another technique is Forward Error Correction (FEC), which splits compact block messages into parts with redundant data, allowing reconstruction of missing parts without waiting for retransmission.\n\nA third approach assumes all nodes have similar transactions in their mempools, allowing relay of the same compact block without recalculation at each hop. These methods work well with centralization but sacrifice the trustless nature of decentralized networks.\n\nThe original Bitcoin Relay Network created by Matt Corallo in 2015 was replaced in 2016 with FIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine).

Using IP addresses of known Bitcoin nodes provided manually\n3.

This process ensures the node becomes well-known and better connected in the network.\n\nNodes maintain connections to several peers for diverse network paths.

This 32-byte root is stored in the block header. For example, with four transactions A, B, C, and D, the leaves of the tree would be their hashes (HA, HB, HC, HD). The parent nodes are created by concatenating and hashing pairs (HAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA || HB))). This continues until the single merkle root is calculated.\n\nIf there are an odd number of elements at any level, the last element is duplicated to create an even number.

Bitcoin Core defends against this vulnerability by detecting duplicate hashes at the end of a list and treating them as invalid.\n\n```\nHA = SHA256(SHA256(Transaction A))\nHAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA || HB))\n```\n\nFor a tree with 16 transactions, to prove a specific transaction is included, a node only needs to produce approximately log₂(N) hashes (4 hashes in this case) as an authentication path.

Unlike the public testnet and signet networks, regtest blockchains are meant to be closed systems for local testing, either with multiple nodes or just a single node.\n\nTo start Bitcoin Core in regtest mode:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -regtest\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest getblockchaininfo\n```\n\nRegtest starts with zero blocks, allowing you to create a blockchain from scratch. You can create a wallet, generate addresses, and mine blocks instantly:\n\n```\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest createwallet \"\"\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest getnewaddress\nbcrt1qwvfhw8pf79kw6tvpmtxyxwcfnd2t4e8v6qfv4a\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 500 bcrt1qwvfhw8pf79kw6tvpmtxyxwcfnd2t4e8v6qfv4a\n```\n\nMining blocks takes only seconds in regtest mode, making development and testing much faster. After mining blocks, you can immediately see your balance (though, as on mainnet, coinbase rewards require 100 blocks of confirmation before spending):\n\n```\n$ bitcoin-cli -regtest getbalance\n12462.50000000\n```",

While miners are incentivized by rewards of new bitcoins, mining's primary purpose is securing the Bitcoin system and enabling network-wide consensus in a decentralized manner.\n\nMiners record new transactions on the global blockchain, with a new block being mined approximately every 10 minutes. Transactions included in a block and added to the blockchain are considered confirmed. This confirmation process creates a topological order of transactions in the blockchain, ensuring that no two valid transactions can spend the same output, thus eliminating double-spending.\n\nMiners receive two types of rewards: new bitcoins created with each block (the subsidy) and transaction fees from all transactions included in the block. To earn these rewards, miners compete to solve a cryptographic hash algorithm challenge. The reward decreases approximately every four years, halving from 50 bitcoins initially to 6.25 bitcoins after May 2020. After approximately 2140, no new bitcoins will be created, and miners will be incentivized solely by transaction fees.",

Each node independently tries to add new blocks to its existing blockchain by linking to the parent block referenced in the block's header.\n\nMost often, a new block extends the current best chain. Sometimes, however, a block might not extend the best chain, creating a temporary fork. Nodes handle this by attaching the new block to a secondary chain and comparing the work between chains. If the secondary chain now has more cumulative work, the node reorganizes its view to follow this new best chain.\n\nBy selecting the chain with the greatest cumulative work, all nodes eventually achieve consensus. This method resolves temporary discrepancies as more work is added to one of the chains. Most forks are resolved within one block, though occasionally they might extend to two blocks if found almost simultaneously.\n\nBitcoin's 10-minute block interval represents a design compromise between fast confirmation times and the probability of forks. A faster block time would make transactions appear to confirm more quickly but lead to more frequent blockchain forks, while a slower block time would decrease forks but make settlement seem slower.",

The industry has evolved from CPU mining to GPU mining, then to FPGA mining, and eventually to ASIC mining with specialized chips. This evolution has dramatically increased the network's computational power.\n\nAs mining difficulty increased, individual miners (solo miners) found it increasingly challenging to discover blocks frequently enough to earn consistent rewards. This led to the development of mining pools, where miners collaborate to find blocks and share rewards proportionally to their contributed work.\n\nMining pools coordinate thousands of miners through specialized protocols. The miners configure their equipment to connect to a pool server, and their hardware remains connected while mining. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is paid to a pool Bitcoin address and then distributed to miners based on their contribution.\n\nTo measure individual contributions fairly, pools use the proof-of-work algorithm with a lower difficulty setting (higher target). Miners earn \"shares\" when they find hash values below the pool target, even if these values aren't low enough to create a valid block. These shares prove the miner's work contribution, and when someone in the pool finds a block that meets the Bitcoin network target, the reward is distributed proportionally based on shares.\n\nThere are two main types of mining pools:\n1. Managed pools run by pool operators who charge a percentage fee\n2. Peer-to-peer mining pools (P2Pool) that operate without central operators using a \"share chain\"",

The most well-known is the \"51% attack\" or \"majority attack,\" where a group controlling the majority of the network's hashing power could cause deliberate forks and double-spend transactions.\n\nIn a double-spend attack, the attacker creates a transaction, waits for it to be confirmed, receives the product or service, then mines an alternative chain that replaces the original transaction with one sending the same coins back to themselves. With sufficient hashing power, attackers could invalidate six or more confirmations, undermining transactions previously considered immutable.\n\nTo protect against such attacks, merchants selling high-value items should wait for at least six confirmations before delivering products or use multisignature escrow accounts. The more confirmations that pass, the harder it becomes to invalidate a transaction through blockchain reorganization.\n\nOther potential attacks include denying service to specific addresses by censoring their transactions. If included in blocks mined by others, the attacker could deliberately fork and remine those blocks while excluding the targeted transactions.\n\nAlthough called a \"51% attack,\" such attacks might be possible with less hashing power, possibly as little as 30% according to some research. The risk is amplified by mining pool centralization, where pool operators control block construction and transaction inclusion.

Every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years), the issuance rate decreases by 50%. The first halving occurred at block 210,000, and subsequent halvings continue to reduce the rate of new bitcoins.\n\nThe rate decreases exponentially over 32 halvings until block 6,720,000 (around year 2137), when it reaches the minimum currency unit of 1 satoshi. After approximately 6.93 million blocks (around 2140), almost 21 million bitcoins will have been issued. Thereafter, blocks will contain no new bitcoins, and miners will be rewarded solely through transaction fees.\n\nThis finite and diminishing issuance creates a fixed monetary supply that resists inflation. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks, Bitcoin has a mathematically limited supply. This controlled issuance leads to a deflationary aspect, where the currency tends to appreciate in value over time due to the constrained supply. While some economists argue that deflation should be avoided, Bitcoin experts contend that deflation caused by predictably constrained supply differs from deflation caused by demand collapse.",

This verification ensures only valid transactions are propagated, while invalid ones are discarded at the first encountering node.

The total reward consists of the block subsidy (newly created bitcoins) and the transaction fees from all transactions included in the block.\n\nUnlike regular transactions, the coinbase transaction does not consume UTXOs as inputs. Instead, it has only one input (the coinbase input) that implicitly contains the block reward. To calculate the reward, the miner adds all transaction fees and the correct block subsidy based on the current block height.\n\nThe coinbase transaction also contains \"coinbase data\" (replacing the input script field), which must be between 2 and 100 bytes. This space can be used by miners for extra nonce values and for identifying the mining pool. As per BIP34, version-2 blocks must contain the block height as a script \"push\" operation at the beginning of the coinbase field.",

Mining involves hashing the block header repeatedly while changing parameters until finding a hash that matches a specific target.\n\nA hash algorithm takes arbitrary-length data input and produces a fixed-length deterministic result (digest). For SHA256, the output is always 256 bits long, regardless of input size. A key characteristic is that it's computationally infeasible to find two different inputs producing the same digest or to select an input that produces a desired digest.\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners must find a block header hash that is numerically less than the target. This target determines the difficulty—a lower target means greater difficulty in finding a valid hash. Finding such a hash constitutes proof that a specific amount of computational work was done, hence \"proof of work.\"\n\nThe target is represented in the block header in a notation called \"target bits\" or just \"bits.\" This notation expresses the target as a coefficient/exponent format. For example, in block 277,316, the value 0x1903a30c represents a target where the exponent is 0x19 and the coefficient is 0x03a30c. This target means a valid block must have a header hash with more than 60 leading bits set to zero—an extremely difficult challenge.",

If the network finds blocks faster than every 10 minutes, the difficulty increases (target decreases). If block discovery is slower than expected, the difficulty decreases (target increases).\n\nTo prevent extreme volatility, the adjustment is limited to a factor of four per cycle. If greater adjustment is needed, it will be accomplished in subsequent retargeting periods. This retargeting mechanism ensures Bitcoin's \"heartbeat\" remains constant over long periods despite changes in mining technology and participation.\n\nImportantly, the mining difficulty is independent of transaction volume.

    "content": "## The Root of Trust in Bitcoin\n\nTraditional security architecture is based on the concept of a \"root of trust\" - a trusted core that serves as the foundation for an entire system's security. Security is typically developed as concentric circles extending outward from this trusted center, with each layer building upon inner layers using various security primitives. This model aims to place most trust in the least complex (and therefore least vulnerable) parts of the system.\n\nBitcoin's security architecture differs fundamentally. In Bitcoin, the consensus system creates a trusted blockchain that is completely decentralized. A correctly validated blockchain uses the genesis block as the root of trust, building a chain of trust up to the current block. Bitcoin applications should use the blockchain as their root of trust rather than placing trust in other components.\n\nTo evaluate a Bitcoin application's security architecture, consider each component and assess the impact if that component were compromised. A properly designed Bitcoin application should be vulnerable only to a compromise of the Bitcoin consensus mechanism itself, with its root of trust based on the strongest part of the Bitcoin security architecture. The numerous hacked exchanges illustrate this principle's importance - they failed because they placed trust in components outside the Bitcoin blockchain, such as hot wallets, centralized databases, and vulnerable encryption schemes.",

Bitcoin also provides transaction atomicity (transactions are either fully valid or invalid), discrete units of value, quorum of control through multisignature schemes, timelocks, data replication across the network, forgery protection, blockchain consistency, and predictable issuance limited to under 21 million bitcoins.\n\nThese primitives can be combined to create applications such as Proof-of-Existence (digital notary), crowdfunding platforms like Lighthouse, and payment channels.

When a node wants to send a payment, it must construct a path through the network using channels with sufficient capacity. Nodes advertise routing information including channel availability, capacity, and fees.\n\nRoute discovery typically uses a peer-to-peer model where nodes propagate channel announcements to peers in a \"flooding\" model similar to how Bitcoin propagates transactions. Once a path is found, the sender initializes it by propagating encrypted nested instructions to connect the adjacent payment channels. Importantly, only the sender knows the complete path - intermediary nodes only see their adjacent nodes, enhancing privacy and preventing surveillance or censorship.\n\nLightning Network implements an onion-routed protocol based on Sphinx, allowing payment senders to construct paths where intermediaries can only verify their portion of the route and identify the next hop, but cannot learn about other nodes in the path, determine the path length, or identify their position in it. The protocol uses fixed-size packets padded with random data to prevent intermediaries from deducing path information based on message size.

While participants in a route can see payments across their channels, they don't know the original sender or final recipient. This enhanced privacy contributes to better fungibility by making surveillance and blacklisting more difficult.\n\nLN transactions settle in milliseconds rather than minutes or hours since HTLCs are cleared without requiring on-chain confirmation. The network can support payments as small as the Bitcoin \"dust\" limit or potentially even smaller, enabling true micropayments. Perhaps most importantly, Lightning Network increases Bitcoin's capacity by several orders of magnitude, with transaction throughput limited only by the capacity and speed of individual nodes.\n\nDespite these enhancements, Lightning Network maintains Bitcoin's foundational principle of trustless operation. Nodes operate as peers without requiring trust, using Bitcoin transactions as enforcement mechanisms.

These can represent digital assets (stock certificates, licenses, virtual property) or physical assets (commodities, land titles, vehicles). Early implementations assigned extrinsic assets to a single satoshi, while newer ones use mechanisms like single-use seals, pay to contract, and client-side validation.\n\nSingle-use seals function like tamper-evident packaging - UTXOs can only be spent once, providing a mechanism to transfer ownership. Pay to Contract (P2C) allows a spender and receiver to agree on data (a contract) and tweak the receiver's public key to commit to this contract. A powerful attribute of P2C is that the contracts look like normal public keys to outside observers, maintaining privacy.\n\nClient-side validation is the mechanism for verifying ownership. When transferring colored coins, the sender provides the receiver with the complete history of transfers, each anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain through regular public keys. The receiver validates this history using their software, needing only the information pertinent to the coins they're receiving.

These off-chain transactions would be valid if settled on the blockchain but are instead held off-chain until eventual settlement. This approach enables extremely high transaction throughput, low latency, and fine payment granularity.\n\nA simple example is a one-way payment channel between Emma (user) and Fabian (video streaming provider). Emma establishes a 2-of-2 multisignature address with Fabian and funds it with 36 millibits (0.036 BTC) - enough for up to one hour of video at 0.01 millibits per second. This funding transaction sets the channel capacity and is recorded on the blockchain.\n\nAs Emma watches video, she creates commitment transactions that gradually shift the balance from herself to Fabian. For example, after 10 minutes (600 seconds), the latest commitment transaction would allocate 6 millibits to Fabian and 30 millibits to Emma. When Emma stops watching, either party can broadcast the final commitment transaction to settle the channel.

    "content": "## Trustless Payment Channels with Timelocks\n\nThe simple payment channel described above has two critical vulnerabilities: if Fabian disappears, Emma's funds are locked in the 2-of-2 multisig address; and Emma could cheat by broadcasting an earlier commitment transaction that favors her. Both issues can be solved using timelocks.\n\nTo create a trustless channel, Emma first constructs both funding and refund transactions simultaneously. She signs the funding transaction but doesn't transmit it yet. Instead, she sends Fabian the refund transaction to get his signature. This refund transaction serves as the first commitment transaction with a timelock (e.g., 30 days or 4,320 blocks into the future), establishing the upper time bound for the channel.\n\nEach subsequent commitment transaction uses a progressively shorter timelock. For example, if commitment #1 is locked until block height +4,320, commitment #2 would be locked until +4,319, and commitment #600 could be spent 600 blocks before commitment #1 becomes valid. This ensures that more recent commitments can be settled before older ones, preventing Emma from broadcasting an earlier state.\n\nWhile timelocks effectively prevent cheating, they have disadvantages: they limit channel lifetime to the initial timelock period, and force a trade-off between allowing long-lived channels and making participants wait for refunds if the counterparty disappears. Additionally, the decrementing timelock creates a limit on the number of possible commitment transactions.",

    "content": "## Asymmetric Revocable Commitments\n\nA more sophisticated approach to payment channels uses asymmetric revocable commitments. In this model, instead of creating a single commitment transaction signed by both parties, each party creates a different commitment transaction that is asymmetric in its structure.\n\nConsider a channel between exchange operators Hitesh and Irene, each funding the channel with 5 bitcoins. Hitesh's commitment transaction has two outputs: one paying Irene 5 bitcoins immediately, and another paying Hitesh 5 bitcoins after a 1,000-block timelock. Irene's commitment transaction is structured similarly but in reverse. This asymmetry disadvantages the party who broadcasts their commitment transaction, as they must wait to receive their funds while the counterparty gets paid immediately.\n\nThe revocation mechanism adds another layer of security. Each commitment transaction's delayed output includes a script allowing redemption either by the intended recipient after the timelock, or by the counterparty using a special revocation key. This revocation key consists of two halves, with each party initially knowing only their half. When advancing to a new channel state, each party reveals their half of the previous revocation key to the other, effectively revoking the previous commitment.\n\nIf Hitesh attempts to cheat by broadcasting a revoked commitment, Irene can use the complete revocation key to claim both outputs before Hitesh's timelock expires, taking the entire channel balance as punishment. This mechanism allows channels to remain open indefinitely with billions of possible state transitions, eliminating the limitations of timelock-based approaches.",

The difficulty adjustment ensures block times remain relatively constant regardless of total network hash power. Meanwhile, transaction verification uses cryptographic signatures to prove ownership without requiring identity disclosure.\n\nThis architecture creates a system that is simultaneously transparent (all transactions are public) and pseudonymous (addresses aren't inherently tied to identities). The decentralized nature means there's no single point of failure, making Bitcoin Cash resistant to censorship and shutdown attempts. The result is a robust digital currency system that can facilitate value transfer globally without intermediaries, representing a fundamental innovation in both monetary systems and distributed computing technology.",

New bitcoins are created through a process called \"mining,\" which involves competing to solve mathematical problems while processing transactions. Any network participant can be a miner, using their computing power to verify and record transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash protocol includes algorithms that regulate mining difficulty, automatically adjusting so that a new block is created approximately every 10 minutes regardless of total network processing power. Additionally, the protocol halves the rate of new bitcoin creation every four years and caps the total supply at 21 million coins, projected to be reached by 2140. This controlled issuance rate makes Bitcoin Cash inherently deflationary, as it cannot be arbitrarily inflated through currency creation beyond the predetermined schedule.\n\nBehind the simple description of a digital currency, Bitcoin Cash represents a technological breakthrough that can be viewed as the \"Internet of money\" - a network for propagating value and securing digital asset ownership through distributed computation.",

While physical currency solves these problems through specialized printing techniques and physical uniqueness, digital currency requires cryptographic solutions.\n\nWhen cryptography became more widely available in the late 1980s, researchers began creating digital currencies, typically backed by national currencies or precious metals. However, these early efforts were centralized, making them vulnerable to government intervention and hacking attacks. Like traditional banking systems, they relied on central clearinghouses to settle transactions, creating single points of failure that were eventually targeted by governments or suffered catastrophic collapses.\n\nBitcoin Cash represents the culmination of decades of cryptographic and distributed systems research, combining four key innovations: a decentralized peer-to-peer network protocol, a public transaction ledger (blockchain), a deterministic and decentralized currency issuance mechanism (mining), and a decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script).",

This paper combined previous innovations like b-money and HashCash to create a fully decentralized electronic cash system that doesn't require central authorities for currency issuance or transaction validation.\n\nThe key innovation was using a proof-of-work algorithm to conduct global \"elections\" every 10 minutes, enabling network consensus about transaction states without a central authority. This elegantly solved the double-spend problem that had previously required central clearinghouses. The Bitcoin network launched in 2009 based on Nakamoto's implementation and has since been expanded by numerous programmers.\n\nBitcoin Cash's total market value has reached billions of dollars, with the network processing transactions as large as $150 million instantly and without fees. Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from public involvement in April 2011, leaving development to volunteers. Beyond its economic implications, Nakamoto's invention provided a practical solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem in distributed computing—achieving consensus without central authorities—with applications far beyond currency in elections, lotteries, asset registries, and digital notarization.",

Like a standalone email server, it handles all protocol aspects without relying on third parties.\n\n2. **Lightweight Client**: Stores the user's wallet but depends on third-party servers for access to transactions and the network. Similar to an email client connecting to a mail server, it trusts external servers for transaction validation.\n\n3. **Web Client**: Accessed through a web browser with the wallet stored on third-party servers, similar to webmail services that rely entirely on external infrastructure.\n\nMobile clients for smartphones can function as full clients, lightweight clients, or web clients. Some mobile clients synchronize with desktop clients to provide a multi-platform wallet experience.

The wallet also displays this address as a QR code that can be scanned by smartphones. Like email addresses, BCH addresses can be shared with others who want to send you funds, but unlike email, you can create new addresses as often as desired for increased privacy, all directing funds to the same wallet.\n\nWhen securing a Bitcoin Cash wallet, it's crucial to use a strong password combining uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information, common words, or phrases that could be easily guessed. Ideally, use a password generator to create a random password at least 12 characters long, as BCH represents real money that can be instantly moved globally if not properly protected.",

Once sent, the transaction propagates across the Bitcoin Cash network through the peer-to-peer protocol. Within seconds, most well-connected nodes receive the transaction and recognize Alice's address. The transaction becomes visible immediately in blockchain explorers like explorer.bitcoin.com/bch, where users can look up transactions by entering an address.\n\nInitially, new transactions appear as \"Unconfirmed,\" meaning they've been broadcast to the network but not yet included in the blockchain. For a transaction to be confirmed, it must be included in a block by a miner. Once a new block is created (approximately every 10 minutes), the transactions within it are considered confirmed and the received funds can be spent.

The new owner can then spend these funds by creating another transaction, continuing the chain.

Wallet applications typically maintain a database of UTXOs associated with their keys. If not, they can query the network through APIs to retrieve this information. For example, using a REST API:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://bchn.fullstack.cash/v5/electrumx/utxos/bitcoincash:qr69kyzha07dcecrsvjwsj4s6slnlq4r8c30lxnur3\n```\n\nThis returns available unspent outputs:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"utxos\": [\n    {\n      \"height\": 603416,\n      \"tx_hash\": \"eef683d236d88e978bd406419f144057af3fe1b62ef59162941c1a9f05ded62c\",\n      \"tx_pos\": 0,\n      \"value\": 1000\n    },\n    {\n      \"height\": 646894,\n      \"tx_hash\": \"4c695fae636f3e8e2edc571d11756b880ccaae744390f3950d798ce7b5e25754\",\n      \"tx_pos\": 0,\n      \"value\": 600\n    }\n  ]\n]\n```\n\nAfter selecting inputs, the wallet creates outputs that encode spending conditions. Each output contains a script that encumbers the value, typically requiring a signature from the recipient's private key to spend it. The transaction must also account for change when the input value exceeds the payment amount. If the sum of outputs is less than the sum of inputs, the difference becomes the transaction fee, incentivizing miners to include the transaction in a block.",

The puzzle is asymmetrically difficult—hard to solve but easy to verify. Miners must repeatedly hash the block header and a random number using the SHA256 algorithm until they find a solution matching a predetermined pattern. The first miner to find a solution publishes the block to the network and claims the block reward.\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash has evolved, mining has transitioned from CPU-based mining to specialized hardware.

Each block built on top of a previous block adds confirmation to the transactions in the earlier block.\n\nFor example, when Alice's coffee purchase transaction was included in block #538345, it received one confirmation.

This happens automatically in response to simple user commands like specifying a recipient address and amount to send.\n\nAn important aspect of Bitcoin Cash wallets is that transactions can be constructed offline. Similar to writing a check at home and later sending it to the bank, a Bitcoin Cash transaction can be created while disconnected from the network and transmitted later when connectivity is available.",

UTXOs are indivisible chunks of currency locked to specific owners and recognized as currency units by the entire network. When users receive Bitcoin Cash, it's recorded as a UTXO in the blockchain.\n\nThere are no accounts or balances in Bitcoin Cash; instead, a user's \"balance\" is derived by scanning the blockchain and aggregating all UTXOs belonging to that user. A UTXO can have any value (denominated in satoshis, with 1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis), but once created, it's indivisible like a coin that cannot be cut in half.\n\nWhen creating a transaction, if a UTXO is larger than the required amount, it must be consumed entirely, with change returned to the sender. For example, spending 1 BCH from a 20 BCH UTXO requires creating two outputs: one paying 1 BCH to the recipient and another returning 19 BCH in change to the sender.\n\n```javascript\n// Example of finding UTXOs for an address\nbitbox.Address.utxo('bitcoincash:qpcxf2sv9hjw08nvpgffpamfus9nmksm3chv5zqtnz').then((result) => {\n  console.log(result);\n}, (err) => {\n  console.log(err);\n});\n```",

Each message contains a message header with a command name (command) indicating the message type, followed by the message payload.

They then request specific blocks with getdata messages and receive complete block data through block messages. SPV nodes use a similar process but request only headers through getheaders messages, receiving up to 2,000 headers in a single headers message.\n\nInventory messages (inv) are used throughout the network to announce transaction or block availability. When a node receives an inv message announcing data it doesn't have, it requests that data with getdata. If the inv message indicates a block, the node requests the block with getdata and receives it through a block message. For transactions, the response comes as a tx message.\n\nThis communication protocol enables efficient data propagation across the network while allowing nodes to request only the data they need, whether they're full nodes synchronizing the entire blockchain or SPV nodes collecting only headers and specific transactions relevant to their wallet addresses.",

This mechanism allows the network to adjust to transient nodes and network problems, organically growing and shrinking as needed without central coordination.\n\nNodes typically maintain connections to multiple peers to establish diverse paths into the network. After initial bootstrapping, nodes remember their most recent successful peer connections, allowing quick reestablishment of connections after a reboot. If former peers are unresponsive, the node can use seed nodes to bootstrap again.\n\nThis peer management can be observed through the getPeerInfo command, which provides detailed information about connected peers including their address, version, connection time, and data transmission statistics:\n\n```javascript\nbchjs.Network.getPeerInfo().then(\n  (result) => {\n    console.log(result);\n  },\n  (err) => {\n    console.log(err);\n  }\n);\n```\n\nFor specialized network configurations, users can override automatic peer management with the -connect=<IPAddress> option, forcing the node to connect only to specified IP addresses instead of discovering and maintaining connections automatically.",

For these devices, Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) allows operation without storing complete blockchain data. SPV nodes, also called lightweight clients, download only block headers without the transactions, resulting in a chain approximately 1,000 times smaller than the full blockchain.\n\nInstead of constructing a complete picture of all available UTXOs, SPV nodes verify transactions using a methodology that relies on peers to provide partial views of relevant blockchain parts on demand. They verify transactions by reference to their depth in the blockchain rather than their height. When examining a transaction in block 300,000, an SPV node establishes a link between the transaction and its containing block using a merkle path, then verifies it by confirming six blocks (300,001 through 300,006) have been built on top, proving by proxy that the transaction wasn't a double-spend.\n\nWhile SPV nodes can definitively prove a transaction exists in a block, they cannot verify that a transaction doesn't exist, creating vulnerability to denial-of-service or double-spending attacks. To mitigate this risk, SPV nodes typically connect randomly to several nodes to increase the probability of connecting to at least one honest node. However, this random connection pattern also makes them vulnerable to network partitioning or Sybil attacks where they might connect to fake nodes without access to the real Bitcoin Cash network.\n\nFor most practical applications, well-connected SPV nodes provide adequate security, balancing resource needs, practicality, and security.

To address this privacy concern, Bitcoin Cash implemented bloom filters shortly after introducing SPV/lightweight nodes.\n\nA bloom filter is a probabilistic search filter that allows SPV nodes to request transactions matching specific patterns without revealing exactly which addresses they're interested in. It's implemented as a variable-size array of binary digits (a bit field) with a variable number of hash functions that always produce outputs between 1 and N (corresponding to the array positions).\n\nTo add a pattern to a bloom filter:\n1. The pattern is hashed by each hash function in turn\n2. Each hash function produces a number between 1 and N\n3. The corresponding bit in the array is set to 1\n4. This process is repeated for all hash functions\n5. The pattern is now \"recorded\" in the filter as M bits changed from 0 to 1\n\nAs more patterns are added, bits may overlap, causing the filter to become less accurate—this is why it's a probabilistic data structure. When testing if a pattern is part of a bloom filter, if all bits indexed by the hash functions are set to 1, the pattern is probably in the filter (a \"Maybe, Yes\" result). However, if any bit is 0, the pattern is definitely not in the filter (a \"Definitely Not\" result).\n\nAn SPV node initializes an empty bloom filter and adds search patterns matching the transaction outputs corresponding to its wallet addresses. After sending the filter to peers using a filterload message, peers test each transaction against the filter and only send matching transactions to the node.",

Since patterns cannot be removed from a bloom filter once added, a node must clear the entire filter using filterclear and send a new one if a pattern is no longer needed.\n\nThis filtering mechanism allows SPV nodes to receive transactions relevant to their wallet without downloading the entire blockchain, significantly reducing bandwidth and storage requirements. The probabilistic nature of bloom filters means there may be some false positives (transactions sent that aren't actually relevant), but this imprecision helps preserve privacy by obscuring exactly which addresses the node is interested in.\n\nThe tuning parameters of bloom filters (array size N and number of hash functions M) allow SPV nodes to balance privacy against efficiency. A more specific filter provides accurate results but reveals more about the node's interests, while a less specific filter produces more irrelevant data but offers better privacy.",

This pool tracks transactions that have been broadcast to the network but are not yet included in the blockchain. For example, wallet-holding nodes use the transaction pool to monitor incoming payments that have been received on the network but lack confirmation.\n\nAs transactions are received and verified, they're added to the transaction pool and relayed to neighboring nodes to propagate across the network. Some node implementations also maintain a separate pool of orphaned transactions—transactions whose inputs reference parent transactions that aren't yet known. These orphans are stored temporarily until their parent transactions arrive.\n\nWhen a transaction is added to the transaction pool, the system checks the orphan pool for any orphans that reference this transaction's outputs (its children). Valid matching orphans are moved from the orphan pool to the transaction pool, completing the transaction chain starting with the parent. This process repeats recursively for any further descendants, potentially triggering a cascade reconstruction of interdependent transactions as orphans reunite with their parents.\n\nBoth the transaction pool and orphan pool are stored in local memory without persistent storage, dynamically populated from incoming network messages. When a node starts, both pools begin empty and gradually fill with new transactions from the network.",

Furthermore, while transaction and orphan pools contain only unconfirmed transactions, the UTXO pool contains only confirmed outputs.\n\nThis database is essential for nodes to validate new transactions efficiently by checking whether the transaction inputs reference legitimate unspent outputs.

Nodes store it as a flat file or in a database (Bitcoin ABC uses Google's LevelDB).

This structure leads to terminology like \"height\" (distance from genesis) and \"tip\" (most recently added block).\n\nEach block is uniquely identified by a SHA256 cryptographic hash of its header, and references its parent block through the \"previous block hash\" field. While a block has only one parent, it may temporarily have multiple children during a blockchain \"fork\" when different miners discover blocks simultaneously. Eventually, only one child becomes part of the canonical blockchain.\n\nThe parent-child relationship is critical to blockchain immutability. If a parent block changes, its hash changes, requiring changes to the child's \"previous block hash\" pointer, which changes the child's hash, and so on through all subsequent blocks. This cascade effect makes deep blockchain history practically immutable, as changing a block buried under many subsequent blocks would require recalculating all following blocks—an enormous computational task.",

Each transaction is hashed with double-SHA256 to create leaf nodes (HA, HB, HC, etc.)\n2. Pairs of leaf nodes are concatenated and hashed together to form parent nodes (HAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA + HB)))\n3.

This approach can also provide redundancy, where individual keyholders maintain multiple keys stored in different locations. Multi-signature setups allow flexible security policies, such as requiring any 3 signatures from a group of 5 authorized signers.",

Documentation for DEX software can be found at [dex-docs.psfoundation.info](https://dex-docs.psfoundation.info).\n\nThe DEX is very different from decentralized exchanges such as on ETH and other EVM chains. There is no liquidity pool. Tokens are offered by a seller, and taken by a buyer. There are only two parties involved. The protocol is *trustless* and *atomic*\n\nIn order to sell or purchase tokens, you will need some BCH and a web wallet. There are two versions of the web wallet: one for buyers, and one for sellers.\n\n## Buying Tokens\n\nAnyone can purchase tokens without any account or permission. All you need is some BCH. Buyers are known as *takers*, because they are taking an Offer. The DEX listings can be viewed and purchased by the Taker web wallet:\n\n- [dex.psfoundation.info](https://dex.psfoundation.info)\n\n## Selling Tokens\n\nSelling tokens is a little more complex the buying them. The Seller's software needs to be online in order to finalize a sale. For this reason you will need an account to sell tokens, or you'll need to run your own copy of bch-dex.\n\nWatch the video below for instructions on how to sell tokens on the DEX, and how to request an account for selling tokens on this site:\n- [dex-seller.psfoundation.info](https://dex-seller.psfoundation.info/)\n\n<iframe width=\"639\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ewHPlb57KM\" title=\"Selling NFTs (simple)\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "---\nsidebar_position: 4\n---\n\n# Data\n\nThe ability to attaching data to a token is what makes the technology really valuable. To start, we have to define a few important terms:\n\n- **Mutable Data** - Data that can change over time.\n- **Immutable Data** - Data that is fixed at the time of token creation. It can never be changed once set.\n- **Genesis Data** - Data written directly to the blockchain to create the token.\n\nOf the three, mutable data is the most interesting. Because a token can track data that changes over time, the token can represent items that also change over time. Some use-cases could be a video game character, a product as it travels through a supply chain, websites or social media content. Anything that needs to be tracked and changed over time. The mutable data can even contain software code that interacts with other software.\n\nEven after the token leaves the possession of the token creator, the creator can retain the ability to update the mutable data. This allows artists to obtain royalties and enforce purchase contracts.\n\n[Here is an example](https://slp-token.fullstack.cash/?tokenid=c9a6ed5c0cdef4f1ea8b71442fb75645cec3078e740db555320a16d5bbe94d74) of a token with all three data types defined above.\n\n## Specifications\n\nMutable data is defined by the following specifications:\n\n- **[PS002](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md)** - Core specification for attaching data to a token.\n- **[PS007](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps007-token-data-schema.md)** - Defines a common schema for reading token data\n\nThe following JavaScript libraries are used for working with token data:\n\n- [slp-mutable-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slp-mutable-data) - Core library for working with token data\n- [minimal-slp-wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimal-slp-wallet) - Contains high-level functions for reading token data.\n\n## Data Hosting\n\nThe *Genesis Data* is the only data written to the blockchain. Because only a minimal amount of data is written to the blockchain, it prevents blockchain bloat and will scale well into the future.\n\nThe *Mutable* and *Immutable* data can be hosted anywhere, but is generally hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), a decentralized network for distributing data. The [PSF File Pinning Protocol](https://psffpp.com/docs/intro/) was specifically developed for hosting this data. It allows token data to be redundently hosted by decentralized network of computers. Hosting costs are very low.\n\n## Mutable Data\n\nMutable data is tracked by a *Mutable Data Address* (**MDA**), which is a standard Bitcoin Cash address. The transaction history of that address is used to track the data as it changes over time. This creates an immutable record of updates. Every change to the data is tracked on the blockchain. The address acts as a *pointer* to the latest data, and all the historical updates are recorded to the blockchain and can not be deleted.\n\nThe holder of the private key for that address is the only one who can update the data. This allows token creators to retain the ability to update data after the token leaves their possession. They can also pass on the private key to allow new parties to update the mutable data.",

The `psf-slp-wallet` is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows you to create and manage these SLP tokens. While creating a basic fungible token is straightforward, attaching and managing **mutable data**, such as a token icon, involves a few more steps that empower tokens with significant functionality.\n\nThis blog post summarizes the process described in a tutorial video on creating fungible tokens with mutable data using `psf-slp-wallet`.\n\n### Understanding Key Concepts\n\nBefore diving into the steps, it's helpful to understand some core concepts related to SLP token data:\n\n*   **Genesis Data**: This is a small amount of data actually written to the blockchain when a token is created. It's fundamental to the token's existence.\n*   **Mutable Data**: This refers to data associated with a token that **can change over time**. A common use case for mutable data is adding a **token icon** for visual identification. It also allows for tracking dynamic information, like a character's stats or a product's location.\n*   **Immutable Data**: In contrast, immutable data is associated with a token but **cannot be changed** once it's set. This is often used for permanent records, such as initial creator information or design intent.\n*   **Mutable Data Address (MDA)**: This is a crucial concept. The MDA is a specific address that **controls the mutable data** for a token. Even if the token itself is sent to someone else, the creator (or anyone holding the private key for the MDA) can retain the ability to edit the token's associated mutable data. This flexibility allows for scenarios like artists enforcing royalty agreements or updating owner information for digital art. The MDA acts like a pointer, and by updating it, you can direct the token to a new version of its mutable data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Fungible Token with Rich Data\n\nTo create a fungible token with a token icon and other mutable data using `psf-slp-wallet`, follow these detailed steps:\n\n#### 1. Prepare and Fund Your Mutable Data Address (MDA) Wallet\n\nIt is considered **best practice** to use a separate wallet specifically for controlling the mutable data of each token, distinct from the wallet that will hold the tokens themselves.\n\n*   **Create a new wallet** for your MDA. For example, you can name it `MDA1`.\n    *   Command: `wallet create MDA1`\n*   **Get the address** of your newly created MDA wallet.\n    *   Command: `wallet addrs`\n*   **Fund this MDA wallet** with a small amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to cover transaction fees. Even 10 cents BCH is typically more than enough.\n\n#### 2. Initialize the MDA\n\nThis step creates an initial transaction on the blockchain, setting up your MDA.\n\n*   **Command**: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-mda-tx -n <MDA_Wallet_Name> -a <MDA_Address>`\n    *   Example: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-mda-tx -n MDA1 -a bitcoincash:qr2u4f2dmva6yvf3npkd5lquryp09qk7gs5vxl423h`\n*   **Record the transaction ID** of this initialization, as it will be needed later to link your token to the mutable data.\n\n#### 3. Create and Upload Your Token Icon\n\nYour token icon needs to be hosted on a network accessible by the SLP protocol, such as IPFS. The video demonstrates using [explorer.psffpp.com](https://explorer.psffpp.com) to upload and pin files.\n\n*   **Upload your token icon file** (e.g., an image) to the network. This process will provide you with an **IPFS Content ID (CID)** for your file.\n*   **Pin the file** to ensure it remains available on the network.\n*   Once pinned and accepted by the network, you'll be able to **get a URL** for your token icon. **Record this URL**.\n\n#### 4. Edit and Upload the Mutable Data File\n\nMutable data is typically stored in a **JSON file**. The video suggests [using templates available on a GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/christroutner/d7a9b8875925ea656f512f6ba4d0084d) to simplify this process.\n\n*   **Edit the mutable data JSON template**. The most important fields for a token icon are `tokenIcon` and `fullSizedUrl`.\n    *   The `tokenIcon` is for a smaller thumbnail, while `fullSizedUrl` is for a larger image. If using the same image for both, populate both fields with the same URL.\n    *   You can also include a `about`, specify `mediaType` (e.g., image, video, music), and add any arbitrary user data in the `userData` field.\n*   **Save your edited mutable data JSON file**.\n*   **Upload this JSON file** to the network (e.g., via [explorer.psffpp.com](https://explorer.psffpp.com)) just like you did with the token icon. This will give you a new **IPFS CID** for your mutable data file.\n*   **Pin the mutable data file** and **record its IPFS CID**.\n\n#### 5. Point the MDA to the New Mutable Data\n\nThis step links your MDA to the mutable data file you just uploaded.\n\n*   **Command**: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-update -n <MDA_Wallet_Name> -c ipfs://<Mutable_Data_IPFS_CID>`\n    *   Example: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-update -n MDA1 -c ipfs://bafkreifhtcnmf577q2s5lfr46ax5qf2jnk7oy3azu5x7ceab6xajcccl3u`\n*   The `ipfs://` prefix is crucial as it tells the application that the file is on the IPFS network.\n*   This command creates a transaction on the blockchain that updates the MDA's pointer to the new mutable data. **Record this transaction ID** as your \"first mutable data update\".\n\n#### 6. (Optional but Recommended) Edit and Upload the Immutable Data File\n\nWhile optional, uploading immutable data is good practice for keeping a permanent record of your initial intentions for the token.\n\n*   **Edit an immutable data JSON template**.\n    *   You can include a timestamp, `userData`, `jsonLd` (JSON Linked Data).\n    *   It's useful to record the MDA and the initialization transaction ID from Step 2, and the first mutable data update transaction ID from Step 5 here.\n*   **Save your edited immutable data JSON file**.\n*   **Upload this JSON file** to the network and **record its IPFS CID**. You generally won't need the URL for this file directly, as it's often referenced by its CID.\n\n#### 7. Create the Fungible Token\n\nNow you can create the actual SLP token, linking it to the mutable and immutable data you prepared. It's recommended to create the token in a **separate wallet** from your MDA wallet.\n\n*   **Command**: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-create-fungible -n <Token_Wallet_Name> -m \"Token Name\" -t Ticker -d <Decimals> -q <Quantity> -u ipfs://<Immutable_Data_IPFS_CID> -h <MDA_Initialization_TxID>`\n    *   `-n`: Name of the wallet to hold the tokens.\n    *   `-m`: Full name of your token (required).\n    *   `-t`: Token ticker (required).\n    *   `-d`: Number of decimals for your token (required). Zero decimals make whole tokens that cannot be subdivided.\n    *   `-q`: Quantity of tokens to create (required).\n    *   `-u`: This flag specifies the **immutable data**. Prefix the IPFS CID of your immutable data file with `ipfs://`.\n    *   `-h`: This flag specifies the **hash that connects the token to its mutable data**. Use the **transaction ID from your MDA initialization** (from Step 2) here. This acts as a \"breadcrumb trail\" that the protocol follows to find the latest mutable data.\n    *   Example: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-create-fungible -n tokens1 -m \"M test one\" -t MTEST -d 0 -q 1000 -u ipfs://<Immutable_Data_IPFS_CID> -h <MDA_Initialization_TxID>`\n\n#### 8. Verify and Use Your Token\n\nAfter creation, you can check your token balance in the specified wallet. You can also send tokens to a web wallet, such as [wallet.psfoundation.info](https://wallet.psfoundation.info), to observe them. Due to the decentralized nature of the network, it might take a few minutes for the token icon and other information to fully propagate and display.\n\n### Updating Mutable Data After Token Creation\n\nOne of the powerful features of SLP tokens with mutable data is the ability to **update that data even after the token has been created and transferred**. This process is similar to how you initially pointed your MDA to the mutable data.\n\nTo update the mutable data (e.g., changing the token icon):\n\n1.  **Create or modify your new token icon**.\n2.  **Upload the new token icon** to the network and obtain its new IPFS CID and URL.\n3.  **Edit your mutable data JSON file** to reflect the new token icon URL. Remember to save this file.\n4.  **Upload the updated mutable data JSON file** to the network, obtaining its new IPFS CID.\n5.  **Use the `token-update` command again** to point your MDA to this new mutable data file.\n    *   Command: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-update -n <MDA_Wallet_Name> -c ipfs://<New_Mutable_Data_IPFS_CID>`\n    *   Remember, you **must use the wallet that controls the MDA** (the one holding its private key) for this transaction.\n    *   This action creates a new transaction on the blockchain, updating the pointer to the latest mutable data.\n    *   **Important Caveat**: You can only update the mutable data **once per blockchain block**.\n6.  Once the transaction is confirmed, wallets reading the token's data will automatically display the updated information, such as the new token icon.\n\nA key advantage of this system is that **all past updates remain recorded on the blockchain**, creating an immutable, auditable record of changes to the token's mutable data over time.\n\n### A Simpler Alternative\n\nThe process described above involves several technical steps. If this seems too complex, an alternative exists: [TokenTiger.com](https://tokentiger.com). As of the video's recording, TokenTiger did not support fungible tokens but was working on it. It provides a more user-friendly interface that hides much of the underlying complexity.",

This is the most comprehensive software for creating and managing tokens. You can create all types (Type 1, 65, 128) of SLP tokens, can mint them, can attach data to them, and can manage multiple wallets.\n\n- [psf-slp-wallet GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet)\n\n<iframe width=\"639\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjgeUIWekoA\" title=\"The Easiest Way to Make NFTs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n# Getting Started with PSF SLP Wallet: Create Your First Fungible Token\n\nIf you're looking to create and manage SLP (Simple Ledger Protocol) tokens from the command line, the [PSF SLP Wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool. In this guide, we’ll walk through installing the wallet, creating a fungible token, and sending it to a token-aware wallet—all from scratch on a brand new Ubuntu 20 system. The process also works on Windows and macOS.\n\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\n\nYou'll need a terminal environment to run the wallet. This could be:\n\n- Ubuntu (or another Linux distro)\n- Windows PowerShell\n- macOS Terminal\n- VS Code terminal on any platform\n\nBefore you begin:\n\n- **Install Node.js** (v20.9 used in the video, but newer versions should work)\n- **Install npm** (Node Package Manager)\n\nTo verify installation:\n\n```bash\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Clone the Wallet Repository\n\nClone the open-source PSF SLP Wallet from GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet\ncd psf-slp-wallet\nnpm install\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can check available commands:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js --help\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create a Wallet\n\nCreate a new wallet using:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-create -n wallet1 -d \"Test Wallet 1\"\n```\n\nYou can list all wallets:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-list\n```\n\nAnd view the addresses:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-addrs -n wallet1\n```\n\nTake note of the **Bitcoin Cash (bitcoincash:)** address. You’ll need it to fund the wallet.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Fund the Wallet\n\nTo create tokens, your wallet needs a small amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)—a few cents is sufficient.\n\nOne quick way to fund the wallet is by using the [web wallet](https://wallet.psfoundation.info), which will generate a BCH wallet you can use to send funds. Transfer ~$0.10 worth of BCH to your new wallet's address.\n\nAfter funding, check your balance:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-balance -n wallet1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Fungible Token\n\nUse this command to create a basic fungible token:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js token-create-fungible \\\n  -n wallet1 \\\n  -m test1 \\\n  -t test1 \\\n  -d 2 \\\n  -q 100\n```\n\nThis creates 100 tokens with 2 decimal places, allowing fractional amounts like `1.00`, `0.50`, or `0.01`.\n\nYou can confirm creation by viewing the blockchain record (a link will be printed in the console) or checking your balance again:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-balance -n wallet1\n```\n\nTake note of the **Token ID** from your balance output—it's required to send the token.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Send Tokens to Another Wallet\n\nTo send tokens, first get a **Simple Ledger address** from a token-aware wallet like the [PSF Web Wallet](https://wallet.psfoundation.info). Toggle to “SLP mode” to see the correct address.\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js send-tokens \\\n  -n wallet1 \\\n  -t [your-token-id] \\\n  -q 100 \\\n  -a [receiver simpledger: address]\n```\n\nYour tokens should now appear in the recipient's wallet. Always use **token-aware wallets** to avoid accidentally burning tokens.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nThis walkthrough showed how to:\n\n- Install the [PSF SLP Wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet) \n- Create a fungible token  \n- Send it to another wallet\n\nFuture tutorials will cover:\n\n- Attaching **mutable** and **immutable data**\n- Adding **token icons**\n- Creating **NFTs and NFT groups**\n\nStay tuned for more advanced features!",

The process outlined involves four steps using the website [TokenTiger.com](https://tokentiger.com).\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Create an account at tokentiger.com**. You only need an email and a password to sign up. After signing up and logging in, you will see a gallery page of recently created tokens.\n2.  **Get free credit**. You can do this by clicking on the \"zero credits\" area. There are two methods to get free credit: email verification or Telegram verification using a Telegram bot. Once verified, you can claim your free credit.\n3.  **Go to the \"create\" section**. You can use an image, a zip file, or a PDF file to tokenize. In the example shown, an image created with AI art was used.\n    *   When using an image, the token icon is automatically created as a smaller version of the image, although you have the option to upload a different token icon.\n    *   There is a toggle option: **\"make NFT payload public\"**.\n        *   If left private (off), someone who receives or buys the token and brings it back to tokentiger can burn the token in exchange for a copy of the file (like the image). This is a common use case for selling digital downloads.\n        *   If made public (on), the image itself will be put on IPFS and will be publicly accessible. This use case is more suitable for displaying and sharing artwork.\n4.  **Name the NFT and create it**. You can provide a name for the token. In the example, the document URL was left pointing to tokentiger for demonstration. After setting the details, you click \"create\".\n\nThe process of generating the token takes a couple of minutes. Once created, you can click a link to see the token on a blockchain explorer. The token will then appear in your collection on tokentiger.com. The source notes that the image may take a few minutes to be pinned and show up. Once the token is in your collection, you can interact with it using icons at the bottom.",

So, yes, any SLP UTXO can also be a Script Bitcoin contract. The only requirement is that the Script output an OP_RETURN with valid SLP encoding in the transactions first output. In practice, this is pretty cumbersome and bugs can lead to tokens being burned.\n\nA different way to create a 'smart contract' would be to drop some high-level code into the tokens Mutable Data. Then the user can use the token like a program, by interacting with an app that looks for those kinds of SLP tokens. It's a much higher-level approach and is not dependent on Bitcoin Script in any way.",

the transaction was included. This is **always present for confirmed transactions**.\n- `time`: When using RPC methods like `getrawtransaction` with `verbose=true`, this typically refers to **the same block time** as blocktime for confirmed transactions. However, if a transaction is still in the mempool (i.e., not yet mined), `time` refers to **when it entered the mempool**, and blocktime will be absent or null.\n\nKeep in mind, that Bitcoin is a decentralized network, so the nodes on the network can not be synced perfectly with time. Block height is used as a replacement for time in the Bitcoin system. \n\n```javascript\nconst timestamp = new Date(1675532168 * 1000)\nconsole.log('timestamp: ', timestamp)\n// timestamp:  2023-02-04T17:36:08.000Z\n```",

    "content": "**Working with Raw Transactions in bch-js**\n\n`bch-js` provides tools to interact with the raw data of Bitcoin Cash transactions. This allows for fine-grained control over how transactions are constructed and processed.\n\n**What are Raw Transactions?**\n\nRaw transactions are the fundamental data structures that represent the transfer of Bitcoin Cash. They contain information about the inputs (where the coins are coming from), the outputs (where the coins are going), and other data.\n\n**Key Functions**\n\n* **`decodeRawTransaction(hex)`**:  This function takes a hexadecimal representation of a raw transaction and converts it into a JSON object. It can decode a single transaction or an array of them.\n\n    ```javascript\n    (async () => {\n      try {\n        let decodeRawTransaction = await bchjs.RawTransactions.decodeRawTransaction('01000000013ba3edfd7a7b12b27ac72c3e67768f617fc81bc3888a51323a9fb8aa4b1e5e4a000000006a4730440220540986d1c58d6e76f8f05501c520c38ce55393d0ed7ed3c3a82c69af04221232022058ea43ed6c05fec0eccce749a63332ed4525460105346f11108b9c26df93cd72012103083dfc5a0254613941ddc91af39ff90cd711cdcde03a87b144b883b524660c39ffffffff01807c814a000000001976a914d7e7c4e0b70eaa67ceff9d2823d1bbb9f6df9a5188ac00000000');\n        console.log(decodeRawTransaction);\n      } catch(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n      }\n    })();\n    ```\n* **`decodeScript(script)`**:  Bitcoin Cash uses a scripting language. This function decodes a hexadecimal representation of a script.\n\n    ```javascript\n    (async () => {\n      try {\n        let decodeScript = await bchjs.RawTransactions.decodeScript('4830450221009a51e00ec3524a7389592bc27bea4af5104a59510f5f0cfafa64bbd5c164ca2e02206c2a8bbb47eabdeed52f17d7df668d521600286406930426e3a9415fe10ed592012102e6e1423f7abde8b70bca3e78a7d030e5efabd3eb35c19302542b5fe7879c1a16');\n        console.log(decodeScript);\n      } catch(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n      }\n    })();\n    ```\n* **`getRawTransaction(txid, verbose = false, usrObj = null)`**:  This retrieves the raw transaction data given a transaction ID (txid). The `verbose` option controls how much detail is returned.\n\n    ```javascript\n    (async () => {\n      try {\n        let getRawTransaction = await bchjs.RawTransactions.getRawTransaction(\"0e3e2357e806b6cdb1f70b54c3a3a17b6714ee1f0e68bebb44a74b1efd512098\");\n        console.log(getRawTransaction);\n      } catch(error) {\n        console.error(error);\n      }\n    })();\n    ```\n\n**Example Use Case**\n\nIf you're building a complex wallet or an application that needs to analyze transactions at a low level, `bch-js`'s raw transaction functions are very useful.",

The constructor accepts an optional mnemonic or WIF key and an options object.\n\n```javascript\n// Import the library (Node.js example)\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\n// --- Basic Instantiation (Creates a NEW wallet) ---\nconst bchWallet = new BchWallet();\n\n// --- Instantiation with Options ---\n\n// Option 1: Using Web 2 REST API (e.g., FullStack.cash)\nconst walletWithOptionsRest = new BchWallet(undefined, { // 'undefined' creates a new wallet\n  interface: 'rest-api',\n  restURL: 'https://api.fullstack.cash/v5/' // Example API endpoint\n});\n\n// Option 2: Using Web 3 Consumer API (e.g., free-bch.fullstack.cash or local consumer)\nconst walletWithOptionsWeb3 = new BchWallet(undefined, {\n  interface: 'consumer-api',\n  restURL: 'https://free-bch.fullstack.cash' // Example public consumer endpoint\n  // Or connect to your own instance: restURL: 'http://localhost:5005'\n});\n\n// Option 3: Using an existing mnemonic or WIF\nconst existingMnemonic = 'minor bench until split suffer shine series bag avoid cruel orient aunt';\nconst walletFromMnemonic = new BchWallet(existingMnemonic);\n\nconst existingWif = 'L3BUek8oq1iijZTkfdRYo8RDxEe3PpB8MyJnh2FSGWAoCjAffQCp';\nconst walletFromWif = new BchWallet(existingWif);\n```\n\n**Important Initialization Steps**\n\nAfter creating an instance, two asynchronous operations need to complete:\n\n1.  **`walletInfoPromise`:** This promise resolves almost instantly once the basic wallet information (keys, address) is generated or derived. You *must* await this before accessing `walletInfo`.\n2.  **`initialize()`:** This method connects to the network (using the specified interface) to fetch the wallet's UTXOs, balance, and token information. It's essential for wallets with existing history but can be skipped for brand new, empty wallets.\n\n```javascript\nasync function setupWallet() {\n  const bchWallet = new BchWallet(undefined, { // Using default REST API\n      interface: 'rest-api'\n  });\n\n  // 1. Wait for basic wallet info to be generated\n  await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n  console.log(\"Wallet Info Ready:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n\n  // 2. Initialize network state (balances, UTXOs, tokens)\n  // This step is crucial for wallets that might have funds or history.\n  try {\n    await bchWallet.initialize();\n    console.log(\"Wallet Initialized Successfully!\");\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Initialization failed:\", err);\n    // Handle cases where the wallet is new or network fails\n  }\n\n  // Now the wallet instance is fully ready to use!\n  // Example: Get balance (requires initialization)\n  try {\n     const balance = await bchWallet.getBalance();\n     console.log(`Balance: ${balance} satoshis`);\n  } catch(initErr) {\n     console.error(\"Could not get balance. Was the wallet initialized?\", initErr);\n  }\n}\n\nsetupWallet();\n```\n\nWith installation and initialization covered, we'll dive into creating and managing wallets in the next post.",

    "content": "### Post 1: Introduction to minimal-slp-wallet\n\nWelcome to the first post in our series on `minimal-slp-wallet`, a lightweight JavaScript library designed for front-end web applications that need Bitcoin Cash (BCH) wallet functionality.\n\n**What can it do?**\n\n`minimal-slp-wallet` provides the core features you'd expect from a BCH wallet engine:\n\n* Create new wallets, import existing ones via mnemonic phrases or WIF private keys.\n* Encrypt wallet mnemonics for secure storage.\n* Send and receive BCH.\n* Send, receive, and list SLP (Simple Ledger Protocol) tokens, including NFTs.\n* Check BCH and SLP token balances.\n* Retrieve transaction history and details.\n* Burn unwanted SLP tokens.\n* Get the current BCH price in USD.\n* Write data to the blockchain using OP\\_RETURN.\n* Verify if a UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) is still spendable.\n* Fetch metadata associated with SLP tokens, like icons.\n\n**Who is it for?**\n\nThis library is ideal for developers building web or mobile applications needing BCH and SLP token support without the overhead of a full node. It powers applications like the `bch-wallet-web3-android` app and the `psf-bch-wallet` command-line tool.\n\n**Infrastructure Flexibility**\n\nOne of the key features is its ability to connect to different backend infrastructures:\n\n1.  **Web 2 (REST API):** Connects to traditional REST APIs like those provided by FullStack.cash.\n2.  **Web 3 (Consumer API):** Interacts with decentralized infrastructure via the `bch-consumer` library, enabling communication with services like the Cash Stack.\n\nIn the next post, we'll cover how to install and set up the library in your project.",

This is used by protocols like memo.cash for on-chain messages or by applications for signaling.\n\nThe `sendOpReturn()` method facilitates this. You provide the message string and optionally a hex prefix (defaults to `6d02` for memo.cash posts) and any additional BCH outputs.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function postMemo(mnemonic, message) {\n  const bchWallet = new BchWallet(mnemonic);\n  await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  try {\n    await bchWallet.initialize();\n\n    // Check BCH balance for fee...\n    const bchBalance = await bchWallet.getBalance();\n    if (bchBalance < 2000) {\n      console.log(\"Insufficient BCH balance for OP_RETURN tx fee.\");\n      return;\n    }\n\n    console.log(`Sending OP_RETURN with message: \"${message}\"`);\n\n    // Default prefix is '6d02' (memo.cash post)\n    // You can specify other prefixes, e.g., for SLPDB: '534c5000'\n    const txid = await bchWallet.sendOpReturn(message /*, optionalPrefixHex, optionalOutputsArray, optionalFeeRate */);\n\n    console.log(`Success!

To see the updated balance in your application, you'll need to call `bchWallet.initialize()` again to refresh the UTXO and balance information from the network.\n\n**Sending All BCH**\n\nThe library provides a convenience method `sendAll()` to sweep the entire BCH balance of the wallet to a single address, minus the transaction fee.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function sweepWallet(mnemonic, destinationAddress) {\n    const bchWallet = new BchWallet(mnemonic);\n    await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n    try {\n        await bchWallet.initialize();\n        const balance = await bchWallet.getBalance();\n        console.log(`Starting balance: ${balance} satoshis`);\n\n        if (balance <= 546) { // Need more than dust to cover fee\n            console.log(\"Balance too low to sweep.\");\n            return;\n        }\n\n        console.log(`Sweeping all funds to ${destinationAddress}...`);\n        const txid = await bchWallet.sendAll(destinationAddress);\n\n        console.log(`Success!

You can customize this via the `fee` option in the constructor.\n* **UTXO Selection:** It automatically selects the required UTXOs from your wallet to cover the amount and fee. It prioritizes using smaller UTXOs first to help consolidate them.\n* **Change:** Any remaining BCH after the send amount and fee are deducted is automatically sent back to your wallet address as a change output.\n* **Donation:** By default, a small 2000 satoshi donation is included in each transaction to support the Permissionless Software Foundation (PSF), the creators of `bch-js` which this library relies on.",

It might be faster or slower than `getTokenData` depending on caching and network conditions.\n* `cid2json({ cid })`: If `getTokenData` returns an IPFS Content Identifier (CID) for metadata, this function (primarily available with the `consumer-api` interface) can retrieve the JSON object stored at that CID.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function fetchTokenMetadata(tokenId) {\n  // Use consumer-api for cid2json functionality if needed\n  const slpWallet = new BchWallet(undefined, { interface: 'consumer-api' });\n  await slpWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n   // No need to initialize if just fetching public token data\n\n  try {\n    console.log(`Workspaceing data for Token ID: ${tokenId}`);\n\n    // --- Method 1: getTokenData ---\n    const tokenData = await slpWallet.getTokenData(tokenId, false); // Set true for TX history\n    console.log(\"\\n--- getTokenData() Result ---\");\n    console.log(JSON.stringify(tokenData, null, 2));\n\n    // If mutable data CID exists, try fetching JSON (consumer-api only)\n    if (tokenData?.mutableData?.metaDataCid && slpWallet.ar.interface === 'consumer-api') {\n        console.log(\"\\nFetching JSON from mutable CID:\", tokenData.mutableData.metaDataCid);\n        const mutableJson = await slpWallet.cid2json({ cid: tokenData.mutableData.metaDataCid });\n        console.log(\"Mutable Metadata JSON:\", JSON.stringify(mutableJson, null, 2));\n    }\n\n\n    // --- Method 2: getTokenData2 ---\n    // const tokenMedia = await slpWallet.getTokenData2(tokenId);\n    // console.log(\"\\n--- getTokenData2() Result ---\");\n    // console.log(JSON.stringify(tokenMedia, null, 2));\n\n\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Error fetching token data:\", err);\n  }\n}\n\n// Replace with a token ID known to have metadata\nconst tokenIdWithMeta = '59a62f35b0882b7c0ed80407d9190b460cc566cb6c01ed4817ad64f9d2508702';\nfetchTokenMetadata(tokenIdWithMeta);\n```",

    "content": "### Creating and Managing Wallets\n\nThis post focuses on creating new wallets, importing existing ones, and securely managing your wallet keys using `minimal-slp-wallet`.\n\n**Creating a New Wallet**\n\nCreating a new wallet is straightforward. Simply instantiate the `BchWallet` class without providing a mnemonic or WIF key.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function createNewWallet() {\n  const bchWallet = new BchWallet();\n\n  // Wait for the wallet details to be generated\n  await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  console.log(\"New Wallet Created!\");\n  console.log(\"Mnemonic:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.mnemonic); // Keep this safe!\n  console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n  console.log(\"SLP Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.slpAddress);\n  console.log(\"Private Key (WIF):\", bchWallet.walletInfo.privateKey); // Keep this safe!\n  console.log(\"Derivation Path:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.hdPath); // Default: m/44'/245'/0'/0/0\n}\n\ncreateNewWallet();\n```\nThe `walletInfo` object holds all the critical details. **Remember to securely back up the mnemonic phrase!**\n\n**Importing Existing Wallets**\n\nYou can initialize the wallet from an existing 12-word mnemonic phrase or a WIF (Wallet Import Format) private key.\n\n* **From Mnemonic:**\n    ```javascript\n    const BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\n    async function importFromMnemonic() {\n      const mnemonic = 'minor bench until split suffer shine series bag avoid cruel orient aunt'; // Replace with your mnemonic\n      const bchWallet = new BchWallet(mnemonic);\n\n      await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n      console.log(\"Wallet Imported from Mnemonic:\");\n      console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n      console.log(\"Private Key (WIF):\", bchWallet.walletInfo.privateKey);\n    }\n\n    importFromMnemonic();\n    ```\n\n* **From WIF:** WIF keys typically start with 'K' or 'L'.\n    ```javascript\n    const BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\n    async function importFromWif() {\n      const wif = 'L3BUek8oq1iijZTkfdRYo8RDxEe3PpB8MyJnh2FSGWAoCjAffQCp'; // Replace with your WIF\n      const bchWallet = new BchWallet(wif);\n\n      await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n      console.log(\"Wallet Imported from WIF:\");\n      console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n      console.log(\"Private Key (WIF):\", bchWallet.walletInfo.privateKey); // Same as input WIF\n      console.log(\"Mnemonic:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.mnemonic); // Will be null when importing from WIF\n    }\n\n    importFromWif();\n    ```\n\n**Changing the Derivation Path**\n\nBy default, the library uses the standard SLP path `m/44'/245'/0'/0/0`. You can specify a different HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) path during instantiation if needed.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function useDifferentPath() {\n    const mnemonic = 'minor bench until split suffer shine series bag avoid cruel orient aunt';\n    const customPath = \"m/44'/245'/0'/1'\"; // Example: First derived address on second account\n\n    const bchWallet = new BchWallet(mnemonic, {\n        hdPath: customPath\n    });\n\n    await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n    console.log(`Wallet using path ${bchWallet.walletInfo.hdPath}:`);\n    console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n}\n\nuseDifferentPath();\n```\n\n**Encrypting and Decrypting Mnemonics**\n\nFor added security, especially when storing mnemonics (e.g., in browser `localStorage`), you can encrypt them with a password.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function manageEncryptedWallet() {\n  const password = 'yourStrongPassword!'; // Use a strong, unique password\n\n  // 1. Create a new wallet with encryption enabled\n  const bchWalletEncrypt = new BchWallet(null, { // 'null' or 'undefined' creates a new wallet\n    password: password\n  });\n  await bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  console.log(\"Original Mnemonic:\", bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfo.mnemonic);\n  console.log(\"Encrypted Mnemonic:\", bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfo.mnemonicEncrypted); // Store this encrypted version\n\n  // --- Later, when retrieving the wallet ---\n\n  // 2. Instantiate the wallet using the encrypted mnemonic and password\n  const encryptedMnemonicFromStorage = bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfo.mnemonicEncrypted; // Retrieve this\n  const bchWalletDecrypt = new BchWallet(encryptedMnemonicFromStorage, {\n    password: password\n  });\n  await bchWalletDecrypt.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  console.log(\"Decrypted Mnemonic:\", bchWalletDecrypt.walletInfo.mnemonic);\n  console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWalletDecrypt.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n\n  // Trying with the wrong password will throw an error during instantiation\n  try {\n      const wrongPasswordWallet = new BchWallet(encryptedMnemonicFromStorage, {\n          password: 'wrongPassword'\n      });\n      await wrongPasswordWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n  } catch (err) {\n      console.error(\"Decryption failed (expected):\", err.message); // Should say 'Wrong password'\n  }\n}\n\nmanageEncryptedWallet();\n```\n**Security Note:** Never send unencrypted private keys or mnemonics to your server. Manage keys client-side and use encryption when storing them.",

    "content": "This directory contains a series of small examples apps that illustrate how\nto code up common use cases for a SLP wallet and managing tokens.\n\n## Running Examples\n\nYou can run each example script by entering its directory and executing `npm start`\n\n## General BCH Functions\n\n- [create-wallet](create-wallet) Create a SLP compatible HD Node wallet on\n  the BCH mainnet. Send a small amount of BCH (0.0001 or more) to the address\n  saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app. All other example apps\n  read this `wallet.json` file.\n\n- [check-token-balance](check-token-balance) Check the token balance of your\nBCH wallet for a single tokenId\n\n- [check-balances](check-balances) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This\n  displays both BCH information as well as SLP token information.\n\n## SLP Token Functions\n\n- [create-token](create-token) - Create a new SLP token class. Run the\n  [create-wallet](create-wallet) example first, and fund your wallet with a few\n  cents of BCH first.\n\n- [create-nft](create-nft) - Create a new SLP\n[non-fungible token](https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens/). Run the\n[create-wallet](create-wallet) example first, and fund your wallet with a few\ncents of BCH first.\n\n- [mint-token](mint-token) - Mint additional SLP tokens for an existing class\n  controlled by your wallet.\n\n- [send-token](send-token) - Send tokens from your address to another address.\n\n- [burn-all](burn-all) - Burn all tokens for an address by tokenId.\n\n- [lookup-token](lookup-token) - Lookup token information based on the token `id`.\n\n- [list-all-tokens](list-all-tokens) - List every token in existence.\n\n- [conversion](conversion) - Convert between address formats.",

    "content": "# Non Fungable Tokens (NFT)\n\nThe examples in this directory show how to generate and work with Non-fugable\nTokens (NFTs) using the [NFT1 Specification](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md).\n\n- [This YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvlpYUx6HRs) walks through the examples in this folder.\n\n## NFT Workflow\n![nft-example.jpg](nft-example.jpg)\n\nThe workflow of NFT tokens using SLP and the BCH blockchain can be non-intuitive. The image above is an example of the workflow. Here are the steps to generating an NFT token:\n\n1. An NFT 'Group' token is created first. This is not an NFT itself, but the raw ingredient from which an NFT is created. This is analogous to a stem cell, which is a cell that has not yet chosen to be a specific type of cell (like bone, blood, or nerve cell), but has the potential to become any of them.\n\n2. NFT Group tokens can be created, minted, and sent just like any other kind of SLP token. The reason these are called a 'Group' token is that they represent a class or group of NFTs. So a Group might represent a class of items like swords, paintings, or concert tickets.\n\n3. A NFT Child token is generated by consuming an NFT Group token. NFT Children are the actual NFT tokens and represent specific things with that class, like Excalibur (a sword), the Mona Lisa (a painting), and Row B seat 24 (a concert ticket).\n\n4. NFT Children can be created and sent, but they can not be minted like other SLP tokens.\n\n## Examples\nThe following workflow is recommended for working your way through the examples in order to learn about working with NFT tokens:\n\n- [Create an NFT Group token](./create-nft-group)\n- [Send an NFT Group token](./send-group)\n- [Create an NFT Child by consuming an NFT Group token.](./create-nft-child)\n- [Send an NFT Child token](./send-child)\n- [Mint another NFT Group token in order to create more NFT Child tokens.](./mint-nft-group)",
