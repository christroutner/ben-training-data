They independently verify the integrity of bitcoins to prevent counterfeiting, debasement, and other issues. This verification is crucial because people only accept money if they believe it will retain value for future spending.\n\nBitcoin Core is the reference implementation used by most full node operators since the network's beginning. It allows users to examine blocks, transactions, and other blockchain data that their node has autonomously verified without relying on any central authority. Running your own node gives you authoritative information about Bitcoin's state not because some entity designates it as such, but because your node independently verifies everything.",

By 2023, it had over 1,000 contributors, with around a dozen developers working nearly full-time and several dozen more contributing part-time. Bitcoin Core implements all aspects of the technology, including wallets, transaction and block validation, block construction tools, and all modern peer-to-peer communication protocols.\n\nWhile Bitcoin Core serves as the reference implementation, many system aspects introduced after 2011 are documented in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs).

List available release tags using `git tag` and then check out the desired stable version:\n\n```\n$ git tag\nv0.1.5\n...\nv24.0.1\n...\n$ git checkout v24.0.1\n```\n\nThe build process begins with the `autogen.sh` script which generates build scripts appropriate for your system:\n\n```\n$ ./autogen.sh\n```\n\nNext, run the `configure` script to customize the build process. You can view available options with `./configure --help`. Common configuration options include:\n\n- `--prefix=$HOME`: Install in your home directory instead of system-wide\n- `--disable-wallet`: Skip the wallet implementation\n- `--with-incompatible-bdb`: Allow incompatible Berkeley DB versions for wallets\n- `--with-gui=no`: Build only the command-line tools without the GUI\n\nAfter configuration, compile the code using `make`, verify with `make check`, and install with `make install`:\n\n```\n$ make\n$ make check\n$ sudo make install\n```\n\nThe default installation puts executables in `/usr/local/bin`, which you can verify with:\n\n```\n$ which bitcoind\n/usr/local/bin/bitcoind\n```",

It uses mathematical functions that are easy to calculate in one direction but infeasible to reverse. Bitcoin specifically uses elliptic curve multiplication, where a private key (k) is multiplied by a generator point (G) to produce a public key (K). This relationship can be expressed as K = k × G.\n\nThe private key is a randomly generated number between 0 and n-1, where n is the order of the elliptic curve (approximately 1.1578 × 10^77^). This number must be kept secret as it grants control over bitcoins. The public key is derived from the private key and can be shared with others to receive funds. When transactions are created, the private key generates signatures that can be verified against the public key without revealing the private key itself.\n\nBitcoin uses the secp256k1 curve, defined by y² = (x³ + 7) mod p, where p is a large prime number (2^256^ – 2^32^ – 2^9^ – 2^8^ – 2^7^ – 2^6^ – 2^4^ – 1).

They're created through a brute-force process: repeatedly generating key pairs until finding one that produces an address with the desired pattern.\n\nThe difficulty increases exponentially with the pattern length:\n- 4 characters (e.g., \"1Kids\"): requires checking about 11 million keys (≈1 minute on a desktop PC)\n- 7 characters (e.g., \"1KidsCha\"): requires checking about 2.2 trillion keys (≈3-4 months)\n- 10 characters (e.g., \"1KidsCharit\"): requires checking about 400 quadrillion keys (≈46,000 years)\n\nLonger patterns typically require specialized hardware (GPUs) or vanity mining pools that outsource the work. Once found, vanity addresses function like any other Bitcoin address - the vanity pattern doesn't affect security.\n\nHowever, vanity addresses have become rare in modern Bitcoin usage for two main reasons:\n1. They're incompatible with deterministic wallet generation\n2. Using the same address multiple times (address reuse) reduces privacy for both the recipient and those transacting with them\n\nUnless these problems are solved, vanity addresses will likely remain uncommon despite their memorable appearance.",

This allows Bitcoin to create secure commitments to public keys without revealing them until spending.\n\nBitcoin commonly uses SHA256 and RIPEMD-160 hash functions. To create commitments to public keys, Bitcoin applies SHA256 followed by RIPEMD-160 (known as HASH160), producing a 20-byte result instead of the 65-byte public key:\n\n```\nA = RIPEMD160(SHA256(K))\n```\n\nThis hash can be used in Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH) scripts:\n```\nOutput script: OP_DUP OP_HASH160 <Bob's key hash> OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG\nInput script: <Bob's signature> <Bob's public key>\n```\n\nWhen executed, this script duplicates the public key, hashes it, and verifies it matches the commitment from the output script before checking the signature.

Rather than putting complex conditions in the output script, P2SH places a commitment (hash) to a redemption script.\n\nThe process works as follows:\n\n1. The receiver creates a redemption script with desired spending conditions (e.g., requiring multiple signatures)\n2. This script is hashed using HASH160: `commitment = RIPEMD160(SHA256(script))`\n3. The output script follows a simple template: `OP_HASH160 <commitment> OP_EQUAL`\n4. When spending, the input script includes the full redemption script plus data to satisfy it: `<data> <redemption script>`\n\nFor example, to create a 2-of-2 multisignature requirement:\n```\nRedemption script: <public key 1> OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY <public key 2> OP_CHECKSIG\nOutput script: OP_HASH160 <hash of redemption script> OP_EQUAL\nInput script: <signature2> <signature1> <redemption script>\n```\n\nP2SH addresses use Base58Check encoding with version prefix 0x05, resulting in addresses that start with \"3\". This innovation allowed complex scripts to be used without burdening senders with their complexity, enabling advanced features like multisignature setups.\n\nHowever, P2SH has a security limitation: it's vulnerable to collision attacks when multiple parties construct the redemption script, offering only 80 bits of collision resistance in these scenarios instead of the expected 160 bits.",

To counter this risk, HD wallets provide hardened derivation, which breaks the relationship between parent public key and child chain code.\n\nHardened derivation uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" that prevents compromise of parent or sibling keys. Index numbers for hardened derivation range from 2^31 to 2^32-1 and are displayed with a prime symbol (e.g., 0').\n\nAs a best practice, level-1 children of master keys are always derived through hardened derivation to prevent compromise of master keys. This means an extended public key should be derived from a hardened parent rather than a normal parent.",

The person who has the corresponding private key can then use the same sequence to create the matching private keys. This separation is powerful for security - the frontend wallet can distribute public keys without ever needing access to private keys, while a more secure hardware signing device can hold the private keys safely offline.\n\nThis arrangement is commonly used for hardware signing devices and provides a clear security boundary between the frontend wallet application (which distributes public keys) and the signing operations (which require private keys).",

The child key derivation process can be repeated to create grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and so on to arbitrary depth.\n\nPublic child key derivation allows deriving child public keys directly from parent public keys without knowing the private keys. This enables useful security arrangements where a server can generate new addresses without having any private keys. The mechanism is similar to private key derivation but uses the parent public key as input.\n\nAn important consideration when using extended public keys is the \"gap limit\" - the maximum number of unused keys in a row a wallet will scan before stopping.

This approach offers significant advantages:\n- Reduces transaction size, especially for complex scripts\n- Increases privacy by only revealing the used condition\n- Enables a practically unlimited number of spending conditions\n- Can be optimized to place frequently used conditions in more efficient positions\n\nFor a complex script with just 16 commitments (512 bytes), MAST could support over 32,000 different spending conditions, far more than could be used with traditional script constructs.",

These public keys are combined to create a multisignature public key that looks identical to any regular Bitcoin public key.

The sender adds the hash of the contract to the recipient's public key and pays to the resulting key. The recipient can spend by tweaking their private key with the same value.\n\nThis allows the sender to later prove what they paid for by revealing the original key and the contract description, while maintaining complete privacy unless the parties choose to reveal the details.",

Script is also stateless, meaning there's no state before or after execution, and all necessary information is contained within the script itself. This ensures predictable execution across all nodes in the network.\n\nWhen validating a transaction, each input in a transaction is validated separately. The validation process copies the input script, retrieves the UTXO referenced by the input, and copies the output script from that UTXO. Both scripts are then executed together, with the input script needing to satisfy the output script's conditions for the transaction to be valid.",

To mitigate this risk, the industry best practice is to deterministically derive k using both the transaction data and the private key, ensuring each transaction produces a different k value.\n\nFor ECDSA, RFC6979 defines the standard algorithm for deterministic initialization of k. For Schnorr signatures, BIP340 recommends a default signing algorithm.

The legacy commitment hash calculation method had a vulnerability: the number of hash operations increased quadratically with the number of inputs, potentially allowing attackers to create transactions requiring excessive hash operations to verify.\n\nSegregated Witness (SegWit) addressed this issue by changing how the commitment hash is calculated. For SegWit version 0 witness programs, signature verification uses the improved algorithm specified in BIP143, which scales linearly (O(n)) with the number of signature operations rather than quadratically. This improvement reduces the potential for denial-of-service attacks using overly complex transactions.\n\nThe new algorithm maintains security while significantly improving efficiency, especially for transactions with multiple inputs, making the Bitcoin network more resistant to certain types of attacks.",

For Bitcoin, the \"message\" being signed is typically not the entire transaction but rather a specific subset of transaction data called the commitment hash.\n\nThe signature is created using a function that can be represented as:\n\n```\nSig = F_sig(F_hash(m), x)\n```\n\nWhere:\n- x is the signing private key\n- m is the message/commitment hash\n- F_hash is the hashing function\n- F_sig is the signing algorithm\n- Sig is the resulting signature\n\nBoth Schnorr and ECDSA signatures produce two values that are serialized differently. ECDSA uses the Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format, while Schnorr signatures use a simpler serialization format. Verification of a signature requires the message, the signer's public key, and the signature itself to confirm that only the controller of the private key could have produced that specific signature for that specific transaction.",

The signer selects a private key x and derives public key xG\n2. To sign, the signer generates a private nonce k and derives public nonce kG\n3.

In this scheme, multiple parties can cooperate to create a single signature that proves they collectively know the sum of their private keys, without revealing individual private keys.\n\nThe basic protocol works as follows:\n\n1. Participants Alice and Bob each have private keys y and z, respectively\n2. They derive public keys yG and zG, then combine them to create an aggregated public key xG = yG + zG\n3. Each chooses a private nonce (a for Alice, b for Bob) and derives public nonces aG and bG\n4. They produce an aggregated public nonce kG = aG + bG\n5. They generate a challenge scalar e = hash(kG || xG || m)\n6. Alice computes q = a + ey and Bob computes r = b + ez\n7. They combine these to form s = q + r\n8. The final signature is (kG, s)\n\nHowever, this basic protocol is vulnerable to key cancellation attacks, where one party might learn another's public key before committing to their own, potentially allowing them to create a valid signature without the other's participation. Various security measures, like commitment schemes, have been developed to address this issue.\n\nThe MuSig family of protocols offers secure implementations:\n- MuSig (MuSig1): Simple but requires three rounds of communication\n- MuSig2 (BIP327): Requires only two rounds of communication, more efficient\n- MuSig-DN: Uses deterministic nonces to eliminate repeated session attacks",

For a transaction to be confirmed, it must be included in a block. Miners select which transactions to include in blocks, and typically select transactions that maximize their revenue.

For example, instead of mining block #100,001, miners might attempt to remine block #100,000 but include high-fee transactions from the current mempool.\n\nCurrently, this attack isn't very lucrative because block subsidies are much higher than total fees per block. However, as transaction fees eventually become the majority of miner rewards, this scenario becomes more likely.\n\nSeveral wallets discourage fee sniping by creating transactions with a lock time that limits them to being included only in the next block or later blocks. In our example, a wallet would set lock time to 100,001. This prevents miners from including these transactions in remined blocks, making fee sniping less profitable.\n\nThis approach doesn't entirely prevent fee sniping but helps preserve network stability as block subsidies decline.

This approach accommodates the technical structure of Bitcoin and matches practical expectations, as spenders often have the highest desire to see transactions confirm quickly.\n\nMiners evaluate transactions by dividing the fee by the transaction's size (weight) to find the highest fee per weight, called the \"fee rate.\" This is analogous to comparison shopping by price per unit. Fee rates can be expressed in different units:\n- BTC/Bytes or BTC/Kilobytes (legacy units)\n- BTC/Vbytes or BTC/Kilo-vbyte\n- Satoshi/Vbyte (most common today)\n- Satoshi/Weight (also common)\n\nIt's crucial to be careful when accepting fee rate inputs.

    "content": "## Replace By Fee (RBF) Fee Bumping\n\nRBF fee bumping involves creating a conflicting version of a transaction that pays a higher fee. Transactions conflict when they each try to spend one of the same UTXOs. To prevent network abuse through excessive transaction creation, Bitcoin Core and other nodes that support transaction replacement require each replacement transaction to pay a higher fee rate than the transaction being replaced.\n\nBitcoin Core supports two variations of RBF:\n- **Opt-in RBF**: Transactions can signal that they allow replacement with higher fee rate versions. This is specified in BIP125 and enabled by default in Bitcoin Core.\n- **Full RBF**: Any unconfirmed transaction can be replaced with a higher fee rate version. This is optionally available in Bitcoin Core but disabled by default.\n\nThe existence of two variants stems from controversy around transaction replacement. Some merchants relied on the assumption that valid unconfirmed transactions would eventually confirm. Transaction replacement breaks this assumption since an alternative version might not pay the same outputs. As a compromise, Bitcoin Core implemented opt-in RBF, where only transactions signaling replacement permission could be replaced.\n\nWhen implementing RBF fee bumping, a wallet creates a new transaction that spends at least one of the same UTXOs as the original transaction, usually keeping the same outputs that pay the receiver(s). The increased fee can be paid by reducing the change output value or adding additional inputs to the transaction.\n\nThe advantage of RBF is its efficiency in using block space. The disadvantage is that normally only the transaction creator can perform RBF fee bumping, with limited exceptions for specially designed transactions.",

Since miners must confirm the parent transaction to include the child transaction, they will evaluate the profitability of confirming both transactions together as a package.\n\nTo evaluate package profitability, miners calculate the \"package fee rate\" by dividing the aggregate fees of all transactions in the package by their aggregate size. Miners sort all individual transactions and packages by fee rate and include the highest-revenue ones in their blocks. This process, called \"ancestor fee rate mining,\" has been implemented in Bitcoin Core for years and is used by most miners.\n\nCPFP has several advantages over RBF. Any recipient of a transaction output can use CPFP, including both payment recipients and the spender (if they included a change output). It also doesn't replace the original transaction, making it less disruptive to merchants than RBF.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of CPFP is that it typically uses more block space.

Later versions limited mempool size to store only the highest fee rate transactions or packages. This creates a dependency problem for CPFP: to calculate a package fee rate, nodes need both parent and child transactions, but if the parent doesn't pay a high enough fee rate, it won't be kept in the mempool.\n\nPackage relay solves this by allowing transactions to be relayed as a package, enabling receiving nodes to evaluate the fee rate of the entire package before acting on individual transactions. As of writing, significant progress has been made on implementing package relay in Bitcoin Core.\n\nThis feature is especially important for protocols based on time-sensitive presigned transactions, such as Lightning Network. In non-cooperative scenarios, some transactions can't be fee bumped using RBF and must rely on CPFP. If a presigned transaction pays too low a fee rate to enter the mempool, there's no way to fee bump it with a child transaction. Package relay solves this critical problem.",

This means if Alice creates a small transaction paying Bob, and Bob creates a large child transaction, Alice would need to pay a fee larger than what both she and Bob originally paid to replace her transaction.\n\nFor CPFP, Bitcoin Core limits a parent transaction to having a maximum of 25 ancestors or descendants in its mempool and limits the total size of all those transactions to 100,000 vbytes. This prevents users from creating CPFP fee bumps if a transaction already has too many descendants.\n\nTransaction pinning can happen accidentally, but it also represents a serious vulnerability for multiparty time-sensitive protocols like Lightning Network.

These transactions might need to be broadcast at unknown future times, making fee rate estimation impossible. Both RBF and CPFP are vulnerable to transaction pinning, which could allow malicious parties to steal funds.\n\nThe solution was \"CPFP carve out\": an exception to CPFP rules allowing a single additional transaction up to 1,000 vbytes to be added to a package even if it exceeds normal limits, as long as it's a direct child of an unconfirmed transaction with no unconfirmed ancestors.\n\nFor example, Bob and Mallory co-sign a transaction with outputs to each of them. If Mallory broadcasts the transaction and attaches many child transactions to her output, normally Bob would be unable to attach a child transaction for CPFP fee bumping. With carve-out, he can spend his output as long as his child transaction is less than 1,000 vbytes.\n\nCPFP carve-out works only once, making it suitable only for two-party protocols.

The receiving node can check if it already has these transactions in its mempool and only request the missing ones.\n\nBitcoin Core implements two modes of compact block relay:\n\n* **Low-bandwidth mode**: The peer sends only the block header hash without details, saving bandwidth when the receiving node might get the block from another source.\n* **High-bandwidth mode**: The peer sends the compact block before full verification, only ensuring the proof of work is correct. This minimizes propagation delays at each hop.\n\nWhile the names might be confusing, both modes significantly reduce bandwidth compared to pre-compact block methods.",

These networks use techniques that aren't suitable for the public P2P network due to trade-offs in decentralization and trust.\n\nOne approach is to preselect routes between endpoints, using servers near major internet infrastructure. Another technique is Forward Error Correction (FEC), which splits compact block messages into parts with redundant data, allowing reconstruction of missing parts without waiting for retransmission.\n\nA third approach assumes all nodes have similar transactions in their mempools, allowing relay of the same compact block without recalculation at each hop. These methods work well with centralization but sacrifice the trustless nature of decentralized networks.\n\nThe original Bitcoin Relay Network created by Matt Corallo in 2015 was replaced in 2016 with FIBRE (Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine). FIBRE uses UDP-based relay with FEC and compact block optimization to further reduce data transmitted and network latency.",

New nodes discover peers through several methods:\n\n1. Querying DNS seeds (DNS servers providing lists of Bitcoin node IP addresses)\n2. Using IP addresses of known Bitcoin nodes provided manually\n3. Receiving introductions from already-connected nodes\n\nAfter establishing connections, a node sends an `addr` message with its IP address to neighbors, who forward it to their neighbors. The node can also send `getaddr` to request IP addresses of other peers. This process ensures the node becomes well-known and better connected in the network.\n\nNodes maintain connections to several peers for diverse network paths. Since connections are unreliable as nodes come and go, nodes continue discovering new peers while assisting others with bootstrapping.

This 32-byte root is stored in the block header. For example, with four transactions A, B, C, and D, the leaves of the tree would be their hashes (HA, HB, HC, HD). The parent nodes are created by concatenating and hashing pairs (HAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA || HB))). This continues until the single merkle root is calculated.\n\nIf there are an odd number of elements at any level, the last element is duplicated to create an even number. This duplication creates a design flaw in Bitcoin's implementation that can allow certain sequences of transactions to produce the same merkle root. Bitcoin Core defends against this vulnerability by detecting duplicate hashes at the end of a list and treating them as invalid.\n\n```\nHA = SHA256(SHA256(Transaction A))\nHAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA || HB))\n```\n\nFor a tree with 16 transactions, to prove a specific transaction is included, a node only needs to produce approximately log₂(N) hashes (4 hashes in this case) as an authentication path.

Testnet is a fully featured live P2P network with wallets, mining, and all mainnet features, but its coins are intentionally worthless. This allows developers to test their software without risking real money or endangering the main network.\n\nThe current implementation is testnet3, the third iteration, restarted in February 2011. It's a substantial blockchain (over 30 GB in 2023) that takes time to sync. Testnet addresses are distinguished from mainnet addresses by different prefixes (testnet addresses begin with m, n, or tb1 instead of 1, 3, or bc1) to prevent accidental sending of real bitcoins to test addresses.\n\nTo use testnet with Bitcoin Core, start the software with the `-testnet` flag:\n\n```\n$ bitcoind -testnet\n$ bitcoin-cli -testnet getblockchaininfo\n```\n\nTestnet supports all mainnet features, including segregated witness and taproot, making it useful for comprehensive testing. However, testnet has a fundamental problem: since its proof-of-work security depends on economic incentives that don't exist in a valueless test environment, disruptive miners can create blocks without including user transactions, sometimes making testnet temporarily unusable.",

While miners are incentivized by rewards of new bitcoins, mining's primary purpose is securing the Bitcoin system and enabling network-wide consensus in a decentralized manner.\n\nMiners record new transactions on the global blockchain, with a new block being mined approximately every 10 minutes. Transactions included in a block and added to the blockchain are considered confirmed. This confirmation process creates a topological order of transactions in the blockchain, ensuring that no two valid transactions can spend the same output, thus eliminating double-spending.\n\nMiners receive two types of rewards: new bitcoins created with each block (the subsidy) and transaction fees from all transactions included in the block. To earn these rewards, miners compete to solve a cryptographic hash algorithm challenge. The reward decreases approximately every four years, halving from 50 bitcoins initially to 6.25 bitcoins after May 2020. After approximately 2140, no new bitcoins will be created, and miners will be incentivized solely by transaction fees.",

Each node independently tries to add new blocks to its existing blockchain by linking to the parent block referenced in the block's header.\n\nMost often, a new block extends the current best chain. Sometimes, however, a block might not extend the best chain, creating a temporary fork. Nodes handle this by attaching the new block to a secondary chain and comparing the work between chains. If the secondary chain now has more cumulative work, the node reorganizes its view to follow this new best chain.\n\nBy selecting the chain with the greatest cumulative work, all nodes eventually achieve consensus. This method resolves temporary discrepancies as more work is added to one of the chains. Most forks are resolved within one block, though occasionally they might extend to two blocks if found almost simultaneously.\n\nBitcoin's 10-minute block interval represents a design compromise between fast confirmation times and the probability of forks. A faster block time would make transactions appear to confirm more quickly but lead to more frequent blockchain forks, while a slower block time would decrease forks but make settlement seem slower.",

The industry has evolved from CPU mining to GPU mining, then to FPGA mining, and eventually to ASIC mining with specialized chips. This evolution has dramatically increased the network's computational power.\n\nAs mining difficulty increased, individual miners (solo miners) found it increasingly challenging to discover blocks frequently enough to earn consistent rewards. This led to the development of mining pools, where miners collaborate to find blocks and share rewards proportionally to their contributed work.\n\nMining pools coordinate thousands of miners through specialized protocols. The miners configure their equipment to connect to a pool server, and their hardware remains connected while mining. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is paid to a pool Bitcoin address and then distributed to miners based on their contribution.\n\nTo measure individual contributions fairly, pools use the proof-of-work algorithm with a lower difficulty setting (higher target). Miners earn \"shares\" when they find hash values below the pool target, even if these values aren't low enough to create a valid block. These shares prove the miner's work contribution, and when someone in the pool finds a block that meets the Bitcoin network target, the reward is distributed proportionally based on shares.\n\nThere are two main types of mining pools:\n1. Managed pools run by pool operators who charge a percentage fee\n2. Peer-to-peer mining pools (P2Pool) that operate without central operators using a \"share chain\"",

The most well-known is the \"51% attack\" or \"majority attack,\" where a group controlling the majority of the network's hashing power could cause deliberate forks and double-spend transactions.\n\nIn a double-spend attack, the attacker creates a transaction, waits for it to be confirmed, receives the product or service, then mines an alternative chain that replaces the original transaction with one sending the same coins back to themselves. With sufficient hashing power, attackers could invalidate six or more confirmations, undermining transactions previously considered immutable.\n\nTo protect against such attacks, merchants selling high-value items should wait for at least six confirmations before delivering products or use multisignature escrow accounts. The more confirmations that pass, the harder it becomes to invalidate a transaction through blockchain reorganization.\n\nOther potential attacks include denying service to specific addresses by censoring their transactions. If included in blocks mined by others, the attacker could deliberately fork and remine those blocks while excluding the targeted transactions.\n\nAlthough called a \"51% attack,\" such attacks might be possible with less hashing power, possibly as little as 30% according to some research. The risk is amplified by mining pool centralization, where pool operators control block construction and transaction inclusion.

After approximately 6.93 million blocks (around 2140), almost 21 million bitcoins will have been issued. Thereafter, blocks will contain no new bitcoins, and miners will be rewarded solely through transaction fees.\n\nThis finite and diminishing issuance creates a fixed monetary supply that resists inflation. Unlike fiat currencies that can be printed in unlimited quantities by central banks, Bitcoin has a mathematically limited supply. This controlled issuance leads to a deflationary aspect, where the currency tends to appreciate in value over time due to the constrained supply.

A key characteristic is that it's computationally infeasible to find two different inputs producing the same digest or to select an input that produces a desired digest.\n\nIn Bitcoin mining, miners must find a block header hash that is numerically less than the target. This target determines the difficulty—a lower target means greater difficulty in finding a valid hash. Finding such a hash constitutes proof that a specific amount of computational work was done, hence \"proof of work.\"\n\nThe target is represented in the block header in a notation called \"target bits\" or just \"bits.\" This notation expresses the target as a coefficient/exponent format. For example, in block 277,316, the value 0x1903a30c represents a target where the exponent is 0x19 and the coefficient is 0x03a30c.

If greater adjustment is needed, it will be accomplished in subsequent retargeting periods. This retargeting mechanism ensures Bitcoin's \"heartbeat\" remains constant over long periods despite changes in mining technology and participation.\n\nImportantly, the mining difficulty is independent of transaction volume. Bitcoin can scale up without requiring increased hashing power for security. The mining market is primarily influenced by the cost of electricity in relation to bitcoin's exchange rate, as this determines mining profitability.",

In a decentralized network, each participant has their own time perspective, and network latency must be considered. To prevent manipulation of block timestamps, Bitcoin implements two consensus rules: no node will accept blocks with timestamps more than two hours in the future, and no node will accept blocks with timestamps less than or equal to the median time of the last 11 blocks (called Median Time Past or MTP).\n\nMTP was introduced as part of BIP113 to strengthen the security of timelocks and remove incentives for miners to lie about block times. By using the median of approximately two hours in the past, the influence of any single block's timestamp is reduced, and no single miner can manipulate timestamps to gain fees from timelocked transactions prematurely.\n\nThis consensus time calculation affects all timelock implementations including lock time, CLTV, sequence, and CSV. MTP is usually about one hour behind wall clock time, which should be accounted for when creating timelock transactions.",

The validation ensures that only blocks following consensus rules are incorporated, thus maintaining the integrity of the system.\n\nThe validation checklist includes verifying that:\n- The block structure is syntactically valid\n- The block header hash is less than the target\n- The block timestamp is within acceptable limits\n- The first transaction is a coinbase transaction\n- All transactions within the block are valid\n\nThis independent validation by every node ensures miners cannot cheat by creating invalid blocks or claiming incorrect rewards.

Bitcoin transactions authorize only specific values to specific recipients, cannot be forged, don't reveal private information, and cannot be used for additional payments. This means Bitcoin transactions can safely be broadcast over open channels like unsecured WiFi without compromising security.\n\nThe decentralized security model puts significant power and responsibility in users' hands to maintain key secrecy.

Unless you're prepared to invest heavily in operational security, multiple layers of access control, and audits (as traditional banks do), you should avoid taking funds outside of Bitcoin's decentralized security context.\n\nEven with substantial security investments, centralized architectures ultimately replicate the vulnerable models of traditional financial networks.

Security is typically developed as concentric circles extending outward from this trusted center, with each layer building upon inner layers using various security primitives. This model aims to place most trust in the least complex (and therefore least vulnerable) parts of the system.\n\nBitcoin's security architecture differs fundamentally. In Bitcoin, the consensus system creates a trusted blockchain that is completely decentralized. A correctly validated blockchain uses the genesis block as the root of trust, building a chain of trust up to the current block. Bitcoin applications should use the blockchain as their root of trust rather than placing trust in other components.\n\nTo evaluate a Bitcoin application's security architecture, consider each component and assess the impact if that component were compromised. A properly designed Bitcoin application should be vulnerable only to a compromise of the Bitcoin consensus mechanism itself, with its root of trust based on the strongest part of the Bitcoin security architecture. The numerous hacked exchanges illustrate this principle's importance - they failed because they placed trust in components outside the Bitcoin blockchain, such as hot wallets, centralized databases, and vulnerable encryption schemes.",

When a node wants to send a payment, it must construct a path through the network using channels with sufficient capacity. Nodes advertise routing information including channel availability, capacity, and fees.\n\nRoute discovery typically uses a peer-to-peer model where nodes propagate channel announcements to peers in a \"flooding\" model similar to how Bitcoin propagates transactions. Once a path is found, the sender initializes it by propagating encrypted nested instructions to connect the adjacent payment channels. Importantly, only the sender knows the complete path - intermediary nodes only see their adjacent nodes, enhancing privacy and preventing surveillance or censorship.\n\nLightning Network implements an onion-routed protocol based on Sphinx, allowing payment senders to construct paths where intermediaries can only verify their portion of the route and identify the next hop, but cannot learn about other nodes in the path, determine the path length, or identify their position in it. The protocol uses fixed-size packets padded with random data to prevent intermediaries from deducing path information based on message size. Unlike Tor, there are no \"exit nodes\" that can be surveilled, as payments are settled by updating channel balances without broadcasting to the blockchain.",

While participants in a route can see payments across their channels, they don't know the original sender or final recipient. This enhanced privacy contributes to better fungibility by making surveillance and blacklisting more difficult.\n\nLN transactions settle in milliseconds rather than minutes or hours since HTLCs are cleared without requiring on-chain confirmation. The network can support payments as small as the Bitcoin \"dust\" limit or potentially even smaller, enabling true micropayments. Perhaps most importantly, Lightning Network increases Bitcoin's capacity by several orders of magnitude, with transaction throughput limited only by the capacity and speed of individual nodes.\n\nDespite these enhancements, Lightning Network maintains Bitcoin's foundational principle of trustless operation. Nodes operate as peers without requiring trust, using Bitcoin transactions as enforcement mechanisms. This preserves Bitcoin's core values while dramatically expanding its practical capabilities for everyday use.",

These can represent digital assets (stock certificates, licenses, virtual property) or physical assets (commodities, land titles, vehicles). Early implementations assigned extrinsic assets to a single satoshi, while newer ones use mechanisms like single-use seals, pay to contract, and client-side validation.\n\nSingle-use seals function like tamper-evident packaging - UTXOs can only be spent once, providing a mechanism to transfer ownership. Pay to Contract (P2C) allows a spender and receiver to agree on data (a contract) and tweak the receiver's public key to commit to this contract. A powerful attribute of P2C is that the contracts look like normal public keys to outside observers, maintaining privacy.\n\nClient-side validation is the mechanism for verifying ownership. When transferring colored coins, the sender provides the receiver with the complete history of transfers, each anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain through regular public keys. The receiver validates this history using their software, needing only the information pertinent to the coins they're receiving. This enhances privacy while ensuring proper validation of ownership rights.",

When forwarding non-bitcoin assets over Lightning Network, there are two approaches: native forwarding, where every hop must know about the particular asset and have sufficient balance to forward it; and translated forwarding, where only the hops adjacent to sender and receiver need to know about the asset, with intermediate hops only needing to support bitcoin payments.\n\nWhile native forwarding requires separate Lightning-like networks for each asset, translated forwarding leverages the existing Bitcoin Lightning Network but may be vulnerable to the \"free American call option\" problem, where receivers could selectively accept payments based on exchange rate changes.

Emma establishes a 2-of-2 multisignature address with Fabian and funds it with 36 millibits (0.036 BTC) - enough for up to one hour of video at 0.01 millibits per second. This funding transaction sets the channel capacity and is recorded on the blockchain.\n\nAs Emma watches video, she creates commitment transactions that gradually shift the balance from herself to Fabian. For example, after 10 minutes (600 seconds), the latest commitment transaction would allocate 6 millibits to Fabian and 30 millibits to Emma. When Emma stops watching, either party can broadcast the final commitment transaction to settle the channel. In this entire process, only two transactions are recorded on the blockchain: the funding transaction and the settlement transaction.",

Both issues can be solved using timelocks.\n\nTo create a trustless channel, Emma first constructs both funding and refund transactions simultaneously. She signs the funding transaction but doesn't transmit it yet. Instead, she sends Fabian the refund transaction to get his signature. This refund transaction serves as the first commitment transaction with a timelock (e.g., 30 days or 4,320 blocks into the future), establishing the upper time bound for the channel.\n\nEach subsequent commitment transaction uses a progressively shorter timelock. For example, if commitment #1 is locked until block height +4,320, commitment #2 would be locked until +4,319, and commitment #600 could be spent 600 blocks before commitment #1 becomes valid. This ensures that more recent commitments can be settled before older ones, preventing Emma from broadcasting an earlier state.\n\nWhile timelocks effectively prevent cheating, they have disadvantages: they limit channel lifetime to the initial timelock period, and force a trade-off between allowing long-lived channels and making participants wait for refunds if the counterparty disappears. Additionally, the decrementing timelock creates a limit on the number of possible commitment transactions.",

In this model, instead of creating a single commitment transaction signed by both parties, each party creates a different commitment transaction that is asymmetric in its structure.\n\nConsider a channel between exchange operators Hitesh and Irene, each funding the channel with 5 bitcoins. Hitesh's commitment transaction has two outputs: one paying Irene 5 bitcoins immediately, and another paying Hitesh 5 bitcoins after a 1,000-block timelock. Irene's commitment transaction is structured similarly but in reverse. This asymmetry disadvantages the party who broadcasts their commitment transaction, as they must wait to receive their funds while the counterparty gets paid immediately.\n\nThe revocation mechanism adds another layer of security. Each commitment transaction's delayed output includes a script allowing redemption either by the intended recipient after the timelock, or by the counterparty using a special revocation key. This revocation key consists of two halves, with each party initially knowing only their half. When advancing to a new channel state, each party reveals their half of the previous revocation key to the other, effectively revoking the previous commitment.\n\nIf Hitesh attempts to cheat by broadcasting a revoked commitment, Irene can use the complete revocation key to claim both outputs before Hitesh's timelock expires, taking the entire channel balance as punishment. This mechanism allows channels to remain open indefinitely with billions of possible state transitions, eliminating the limitations of timelock-based approaches.",

The difficulty adjustment ensures block times remain relatively constant regardless of total network hash power. Meanwhile, transaction verification uses cryptographic signatures to prove ownership without requiring identity disclosure.\n\nThis architecture creates a system that is simultaneously transparent (all transactions are public) and pseudonymous (addresses aren't inherently tied to identities). The decentralized nature means there's no single point of failure, making Bitcoin Cash resistant to censorship and shutdown attempts.

New bitcoins are created through a process called \"mining,\" which involves competing to solve mathematical problems while processing transactions. Any network participant can be a miner, using their computing power to verify and record transactions on the blockchain.\n\nThe Bitcoin Cash protocol includes algorithms that regulate mining difficulty, automatically adjusting so that a new block is created approximately every 10 minutes regardless of total network processing power. Additionally, the protocol halves the rate of new bitcoin creation every four years and caps the total supply at 21 million coins, projected to be reached by 2140. This controlled issuance rate makes Bitcoin Cash inherently deflationary, as it cannot be arbitrarily inflated through currency creation beyond the predetermined schedule.\n\nBehind the simple description of a digital currency, Bitcoin Cash represents a technological breakthrough that can be viewed as the \"Internet of money\" - a network for propagating value and securing digital asset ownership through distributed computation.",

While physical currency solves these problems through specialized printing techniques and physical uniqueness, digital currency requires cryptographic solutions.\n\nWhen cryptography became more widely available in the late 1980s, researchers began creating digital currencies, typically backed by national currencies or precious metals. However, these early efforts were centralized, making them vulnerable to government intervention and hacking attacks. Like traditional banking systems, they relied on central clearinghouses to settle transactions, creating single points of failure that were eventually targeted by governments or suffered catastrophic collapses.\n\nBitcoin Cash represents the culmination of decades of cryptographic and distributed systems research, combining four key innovations: a decentralized peer-to-peer network protocol, a public transaction ledger (blockchain), a deterministic and decentralized currency issuance mechanism (mining), and a decentralized transaction verification system (transaction script).",

This paper combined previous innovations like b-money and HashCash to create a fully decentralized electronic cash system that doesn't require central authorities for currency issuance or transaction validation.\n\nThe key innovation was using a proof-of-work algorithm to conduct global \"elections\" every 10 minutes, enabling network consensus about transaction states without a central authority. This elegantly solved the double-spend problem that had previously required central clearinghouses. The Bitcoin network launched in 2009 based on Nakamoto's implementation and has since been expanded by numerous programmers.\n\nBitcoin Cash's total market value has reached billions of dollars, with the network processing transactions as large as $150 million instantly and without fees. Satoshi Nakamoto withdrew from public involvement in April 2011, leaving development to volunteers. Beyond its economic implications, Nakamoto's invention provided a practical solution to the Byzantine Generals' Problem in distributed computing—achieving consensus without central authorities—with applications far beyond currency in elections, lotteries, asset registries, and digital notarization.",

There are three main types of Bitcoin Cash clients:\n\n1. **Full Client**: Also called a \"full node,\" stores the complete history of all Bitcoin Cash transactions, manages wallets, and can initiate transactions directly on the network. Like a standalone email server, it handles all protocol aspects without relying on third parties.\n\n2. **Lightweight Client**: Stores the user's wallet but depends on third-party servers for access to transactions and the network. Similar to an email client connecting to a mail server, it trusts external servers for transaction validation.\n\n3. **Web Client**: Accessed through a web browser with the wallet stored on third-party servers, similar to webmail services that rely entirely on external infrastructure.\n\nMobile clients for smartphones can function as full clients, lightweight clients, or web clients. Some mobile clients synchronize with desktop clients to provide a multi-platform wallet experience. The choice of client depends on how much control the user wants over their funds—full clients offer maximum control but require the user to handle security and backups, while web clients are easier to set up but introduce counterparty risks if the service is compromised.",

Bitcoin.com offers various wallet options for different platforms including Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

The wallet also displays this address as a QR code that can be scanned by smartphones. Like email addresses, BCH addresses can be shared with others who want to send you funds, but unlike email, you can create new addresses as often as desired for increased privacy, all directing funds to the same wallet.\n\nWhen securing a Bitcoin Cash wallet, it's crucial to use a strong password combining uppercase and lowercase characters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using personal information, common words, or phrases that could be easily guessed. Ideally, use a password generator to create a random password at least 12 characters long, as BCH represents real money that can be instantly moved globally if not properly protected.",

Once sent, the transaction propagates across the Bitcoin Cash network through the peer-to-peer protocol. Within seconds, most well-connected nodes receive the transaction and recognize Alice's address. The transaction becomes visible immediately in blockchain explorers like explorer.bitcoin.com/bch, where users can look up transactions by entering an address.\n\nInitially, new transactions appear as \"Unconfirmed,\" meaning they've been broadcast to the network but not yet included in the blockchain. For a transaction to be confirmed, it must be included in a block by a miner. Once a new block is created (approximately every 10 minutes), the transactions within it are considered confirmed and the received funds can be spent.

The new owner can then spend these funds by creating another transaction, continuing the chain.

Wallet applications typically maintain a database of UTXOs associated with their keys. If not, they can query the network through APIs to retrieve this information. For example, using a REST API:\n\n```bash\n$ curl https://bchn.fullstack.cash/v5/electrumx/utxos/bitcoincash:qr69kyzha07dcecrsvjwsj4s6slnlq4r8c30lxnur3\n```\n\nThis returns available unspent outputs:\n\n```json\n[\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"utxos\": [\n    {\n      \"height\": 603416,\n      \"tx_hash\": \"eef683d236d88e978bd406419f144057af3fe1b62ef59162941c1a9f05ded62c\",\n      \"tx_pos\": 0,\n      \"value\": 1000\n    },\n    {\n      \"height\": 646894,\n      \"tx_hash\": \"4c695fae636f3e8e2edc571d11756b880ccaae744390f3950d798ce7b5e25754\",\n      \"tx_pos\": 0,\n      \"value\": 600\n    }\n  ]\n]\n```\n\nAfter selecting inputs, the wallet creates outputs that encode spending conditions. Each output contains a script that encumbers the value, typically requiring a signature from the recipient's private key to spend it. The transaction must also account for change when the input value exceeds the payment amount. If the sum of outputs is less than the sum of inputs, the difference becomes the transaction fee, incentivizing miners to include the transaction in a block.",

Any Bitcoin Cash node that receives a valid transaction it hasn't seen before will immediately forward it to other connected nodes. This flooding approach ensures rapid propagation across the entire network, typically reaching most nodes within seconds.\n\nRecipients can verify incoming transactions by checking that they contain outputs redeemable by their keys. They can also independently verify that a transaction is well-formed, uses previously unspent inputs, and includes sufficient fees to be mined in an upcoming block. For small-value transactions (like buying coffee), merchants often accept valid transactions with zero confirmations, as the risk is comparable to accepting credit card payments without ID or signature verification.",

The mining process is competitive, with miners racing to find a solution to a cryptographic puzzle that validates a block of transactions.\n\nThe process works similarly to a giant competitive sudoku puzzle that resets approximately every 10 minutes when someone finds a solution. The puzzle is asymmetrically difficult—hard to solve but easy to verify. Miners must repeatedly hash the block header and a random number using the SHA256 algorithm until they find a solution matching a predetermined pattern. The first miner to find a solution publishes the block to the network and claims the block reward.\n\nAs Bitcoin Cash has evolved, mining has transitioned from CPU-based mining to specialized hardware. Today, profitable mining typically requires application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for Bitcoin Cash mining. Many miners join mining pools to combine their computational resources and share rewards proportionally.",

Each block built on top of a previous block adds confirmation to the transactions in the earlier block.\n\nFor example, when Alice's coffee purchase transaction was included in block #538345, it received one confirmation.

Legacy Bitcoin Cash addresses begin with the number \"1\" and are derived from public keys through a one-way cryptographic hashing function. These addresses are 25-34 characters long, case-sensitive, and contain a checksum to prevent errors.\n\nTo create a Bitcoin Cash address from a public key, two hash functions are applied sequentially: first SHA256, then RIPEMD160. The resulting 160-bit hash is encoded using Base58Check, which includes version information and a checksum. The formula is:\n\n```\nBitcoin Cash Address = Base58Check(version + RIPEMD160(SHA256(public key)))\n```\n\nThis process ensures addresses are relatively short, contain built-in error-checking, and provide a standardized format for sending and receiving Bitcoin Cash. Addresses abstract away the complex underlying cryptography, making the system more user-friendly while maintaining security.",

For example, the same private key can be represented as:\n\n```\nHex: 1e99423a4ed27608a15a2616a2b0e9e52ced330ac530edcc32c8ffc6a526aedd\nWIF: 5J3mBbAH58CpQ3Y5RNJpUKPE62SQ5tfcvU2JpbnkeyhfsYB1Jcn\nWIF-compressed: KxFC1jmwwCoACiCAWZ3eXa96mBM6tb3TYzGmf6YwgdGWZgawvrtJ\n```\n\nPublic keys can be uncompressed (520 bits, prefix 04) or compressed (264 bits, prefix 02 or 03).

The first Bitcoin Cash clients used Type-0 nondeterministic wallets (\"Just a Bunch Of Keys\" or JBOK), which generate random keys with no relationship to each other. These wallets require frequent backups as each key must be preserved separately.\n\nMore advanced are deterministic (seeded) wallets, where all keys derive from a common seed through one-way hash functions. The seed (a random number) combined with other data like index numbers generates private keys. A single backup of the seed is sufficient to recover all derived keys, simplifying wallet backups and migration.\n\nHierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets (BIP0032/BIP0044) organize keys in a tree structure, with parent keys able to derive sequences of children keys. This adds organizational meaning to key relationships and enables public key derivation without access to private keys. HD wallets are created from a single root seed, often represented as a mnemonic phrase (BIP0039) of 12-24 English words that encode the random seed value.",

The chain code introduces randomness, ensuring that knowing a child key doesn't reveal siblings without the chain code.\n\nThe derivation process works by combining these inputs with HMAC-SHA512, producing a 512-bit hash that's split into two parts: the right 256 bits become the child's chain code, while the left 256 bits are combined with the parent private key to create the child private key. This can be repeated to create a tree of keys of infinite depth.\n\nFor enhanced security, HD wallets can use hardened derivation functions that break the relationship between parent public keys and child chain codes. Hardened keys (denoted with a prime symbol, e.g., m/0') prevent a compromised child key from revealing other keys in the tree.

Instead of requiring the sender to include a lengthy script, P2SH uses a hash of the script, shifting complexity from sender to recipient.\n\nWith P2SH, a complex script (like a multi-signature requirement) is hashed, and only this hash is included in the locking script:\n```\nOP_HASH160 <20-byte hash of redeem script> OP_EQUAL\n```\n\nWhen spending, the recipient provides the original script (redeem script) and necessary signatures. The validation happens in two steps:\n1. The redeem script is hashed and compared to the hash in the locking script\n2. If the hash matches, the unlocking script is executed against the redeem script\n\nP2SH addresses use a Base58Check encoding with prefix \"5\", resulting in addresses starting with \"3\". This provides a standard address format for complex scripts, making them as easy to use as regular Bitcoin Cash addresses.\n\nBenefits of P2SH include:\n- Shorter transaction outputs\n- Script complexity hidden from senders\n- Reduced data storage in the UTXO set\n- Deferred storage of complex scripts until they're spent\n- Shifted transaction fee burden from sender to recipient\n\nImportant note: The network accepts P2SH encumbrances even if they hash to invalid redeem scripts, because the script hash gives no indication of the script it represents.

Push the public key hash from the locking script onto the stack\n6. Compare the two hashes for equality\n7. Verify the signature against the public key\n\nThe transaction is valid if execution completes with TRUE on top of the stack.

If a child transaction arrives before its parent, nodes place it in a temporary \"orphan transaction pool\" until the parent arrives. Once the parent arrives, orphans referencing the parent's outputs are released from the pool, revalidated, and the entire chain can be processed.\n\nThis mechanism ensures valid transactions aren't rejected simply because their parent is delayed. There is a limit to the number of orphan transactions stored in memory (defined as MAX_ORPHAN_TRANSACTIONS) to prevent denial-of-service attacks.

SPV nodes use a similar process but request only headers through getheaders messages, receiving up to 2,000 headers in a single headers message.\n\nInventory messages (inv) are used throughout the network to announce transaction or block availability. When a node receives an inv message announcing data it doesn't have, it requests that data with getdata. If the inv message indicates a block, the node requests the block with getdata and receives it through a block message. For transactions, the response comes as a tx message.\n\nThis communication protocol enables efficient data propagation across the network while allowing nodes to request only the data they need, whether they're full nodes synchronizing the entire blockchain or SPV nodes collecting only headers and specific transactions relevant to their wallet addresses.",

This mechanism allows the network to adjust to transient nodes and network problems, organically growing and shrinking as needed without central coordination.\n\nNodes typically maintain connections to multiple peers to establish diverse paths into the network. After initial bootstrapping, nodes remember their most recent successful peer connections, allowing quick reestablishment of connections after a reboot. If former peers are unresponsive, the node can use seed nodes to bootstrap again.\n\nThis peer management can be observed through the getPeerInfo command, which provides detailed information about connected peers including their address, version, connection time, and data transmission statistics:\n\n```javascript\nbchjs.Network.getPeerInfo().then(\n  (result) => {\n    console.log(result);\n  },\n  (err) => {\n    console.log(err);\n  }\n);\n```\n\nFor specialized network configurations, users can override automatic peer management with the -connect=<IPAddress> option, forcing the node to connect only to specified IP addresses instead of discovering and maintaining connections automatically.",

They verify transactions by reference to their depth in the blockchain rather than their height. When examining a transaction in block 300,000, an SPV node establishes a link between the transaction and its containing block using a merkle path, then verifies it by confirming six blocks (300,001 through 300,006) have been built on top, proving by proxy that the transaction wasn't a double-spend.\n\nWhile SPV nodes can definitively prove a transaction exists in a block, they cannot verify that a transaction doesn't exist, creating vulnerability to denial-of-service or double-spending attacks. To mitigate this risk, SPV nodes typically connect randomly to several nodes to increase the probability of connecting to at least one honest node. However, this random connection pattern also makes them vulnerable to network partitioning or Sybil attacks where they might connect to fake nodes without access to the real Bitcoin Cash network.\n\nFor most practical applications, well-connected SPV nodes provide adequate security, balancing resource needs, practicality, and security.

To address this privacy concern, Bitcoin Cash implemented bloom filters shortly after introducing SPV/lightweight nodes.\n\nA bloom filter is a probabilistic search filter that allows SPV nodes to request transactions matching specific patterns without revealing exactly which addresses they're interested in. It's implemented as a variable-size array of binary digits (a bit field) with a variable number of hash functions that always produce outputs between 1 and N (corresponding to the array positions).\n\nTo add a pattern to a bloom filter:\n1. The pattern is hashed by each hash function in turn\n2. Each hash function produces a number between 1 and N\n3. The corresponding bit in the array is set to 1\n4. This process is repeated for all hash functions\n5. The pattern is now \"recorded\" in the filter as M bits changed from 0 to 1\n\nAs more patterns are added, bits may overlap, causing the filter to become less accurate—this is why it's a probabilistic data structure. When testing if a pattern is part of a bloom filter, if all bits indexed by the hash functions are set to 1, the pattern is probably in the filter (a \"Maybe, Yes\" result). However, if any bit is 0, the pattern is definitely not in the filter (a \"Definitely Not\" result).\n\nAn SPV node initializes an empty bloom filter and adds search patterns matching the transaction outputs corresponding to its wallet addresses. After sending the filter to peers using a filterload message, peers test each transaction against the filter and only send matching transactions to the node.",

The probabilistic nature of bloom filters means there may be some false positives (transactions sent that aren't actually relevant), but this imprecision helps preserve privacy by obscuring exactly which addresses the node is interested in.\n\nThe tuning parameters of bloom filters (array size N and number of hash functions M) allow SPV nodes to balance privacy against efficiency.

This pool tracks transactions that have been broadcast to the network but are not yet included in the blockchain. For example, wallet-holding nodes use the transaction pool to monitor incoming payments that have been received on the network but lack confirmation.\n\nAs transactions are received and verified, they're added to the transaction pool and relayed to neighboring nodes to propagate across the network. Some node implementations also maintain a separate pool of orphaned transactions—transactions whose inputs reference parent transactions that aren't yet known. These orphans are stored temporarily until their parent transactions arrive.\n\nWhen a transaction is added to the transaction pool, the system checks the orphan pool for any orphans that reference this transaction's outputs (its children). Valid matching orphans are moved from the orphan pool to the transaction pool, completing the transaction chain starting with the parent. This process repeats recursively for any further descendants, potentially triggering a cascade reconstruction of interdependent transactions as orphans reunite with their parents.\n\nBoth the transaction pool and orphan pool are stored in local memory without persistent storage, dynamically populated from incoming network messages. When a node starts, both pools begin empty and gradually fill with new transactions from the network.",

Unlike the transaction and orphan pools that initialize empty, the UTXO pool contains millions of unspent transaction outputs dating back to 2009, stored either in local memory or as an indexed database table on persistent storage.\n\nThe UTXO pool represents the emergent consensus of the network and therefore varies little between nodes, unlike transaction and orphan pools that reflect a single node's local perspective and can differ significantly depending on when nodes were started or restarted. Furthermore, while transaction and orphan pools contain only unconfirmed transactions, the UTXO pool contains only confirmed outputs.\n\nThis database is essential for nodes to validate new transactions efficiently by checking whether the transaction inputs reference legitimate unspent outputs.

Nodes store it as a flat file or in a database (Bitcoin ABC uses Google's LevelDB).

This structure leads to terminology like \"height\" (distance from genesis) and \"tip\" (most recently added block).\n\nEach block is uniquely identified by a SHA256 cryptographic hash of its header, and references its parent block through the \"previous block hash\" field. While a block has only one parent, it may temporarily have multiple children during a blockchain \"fork\" when different miners discover blocks simultaneously. Eventually, only one child becomes part of the canonical blockchain.\n\nThe parent-child relationship is critical to blockchain immutability. If a parent block changes, its hash changes, requiring changes to the child's \"previous block hash\" pointer, which changes the child's hash, and so on through all subsequent blocks. This cascade effect makes deep blockchain history practically immutable, as changing a block buried under many subsequent blocks would require recalculating all following blocks—an enormous computational task.",

When a node receives a new block, it examines the \"previous block hash\" field in the header to link it to the existing chain.

This structure allows for extremely efficient verification: to check if a transaction is included in a block with N transactions, only 2*log₂(N) calculations are needed.\n\nThe construction process works as follows:\n1. Each transaction is hashed with double-SHA256 to create leaf nodes (HA, HB, HC, etc.)\n2. Pairs of leaf nodes are concatenated and hashed together to form parent nodes (HAB = SHA256(SHA256(HA + HB)))\n3. This pairing and hashing continues up the tree until reaching the single merkle root\n4.

Its decentralized consensus system creates a trusted public ledger using the genesis block as the root of trust, extending up to the current block. Bitcoin Cash applications should use the blockchain as their root of trust rather than any other component. When designing complex applications, carefully examine where trust is being placed—ultimately, only a fully validated blockchain should be explicitly trusted.\n\nTo evaluate security architecture, consider how your application would function if individual components were compromised by malicious actors. A properly designed Bitcoin Cash application should only be vulnerable to compromises of the Bitcoin Cash consensus mechanism itself, with its root of trust firmly based on the blockchain.",

Modern computers maintain constant internet connections and run thousands of software components from hundreds of authors, each potentially having access to user files. A single malicious program can compromise keyboards and files, potentially stealing Bitcoin Cash from wallet applications.\n\nDespite decades of information security advancements, digital assets remain vulnerable to determined adversaries. Bitcoin Cash creates digital assets with intrinsic value that can be stolen and transferred instantly and irrevocably, creating massive incentives for hackers. Unlike traditional financial theft requiring conversion of stolen credentials to value, Bitcoin Cash represents immediate value, eliminating the need for fencing or laundering.\n\nThis increased risk has fortunately accelerated innovation in security solutions. Direct response to cryptocurrency adoption has produced advances in hardware encryption, secure key storage, hardware wallets, multi-signature technology, and digital escrow systems—all creating more robust protection options for users.",

Documentation for DEX software can be found at [dex-docs.psfoundation.info](https://dex-docs.psfoundation.info).\n\nThe DEX is very different from decentralized exchanges such as on ETH and other EVM chains. There is no liquidity pool. Tokens are offered by a seller, and taken by a buyer. There are only two parties involved. The protocol is *trustless* and *atomic*\n\nIn order to sell or purchase tokens, you will need some BCH and a web wallet. There are two versions of the web wallet: one for buyers, and one for sellers.\n\n## Buying Tokens\n\nAnyone can purchase tokens without any account or permission. All you need is some BCH. Buyers are known as *takers*, because they are taking an Offer. The DEX listings can be viewed and purchased by the Taker web wallet:\n\n- [dex.psfoundation.info](https://dex.psfoundation.info)\n\n## Selling Tokens\n\nSelling tokens is a little more complex the buying them. The Seller's software needs to be online in order to finalize a sale. For this reason you will need an account to sell tokens, or you'll need to run your own copy of bch-dex.\n\nWatch the video below for instructions on how to sell tokens on the DEX, and how to request an account for selling tokens on this site:\n- [dex-seller.psfoundation.info](https://dex-seller.psfoundation.info/)\n\n<iframe width=\"639\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ewHPlb57KM\" title=\"Selling NFTs (simple)\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

    "content": "---\nsidebar_position: 4\n---\n\n# Data\n\nThe ability to attaching data to a token is what makes the technology really valuable. To start, we have to define a few important terms:\n\n- **Mutable Data** - Data that can change over time.\n- **Immutable Data** - Data that is fixed at the time of token creation. It can never be changed once set.\n- **Genesis Data** - Data written directly to the blockchain to create the token.\n\nOf the three, mutable data is the most interesting. Because a token can track data that changes over time, the token can represent items that also change over time. Some use-cases could be a video game character, a product as it travels through a supply chain, websites or social media content. Anything that needs to be tracked and changed over time. The mutable data can even contain software code that interacts with other software.\n\nEven after the token leaves the possession of the token creator, the creator can retain the ability to update the mutable data. This allows artists to obtain royalties and enforce purchase contracts.\n\n[Here is an example](https://slp-token.fullstack.cash/?tokenid=c9a6ed5c0cdef4f1ea8b71442fb75645cec3078e740db555320a16d5bbe94d74) of a token with all three data types defined above.\n\n## Specifications\n\nMutable data is defined by the following specifications:\n\n- **[PS002](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps002-slp-mutable-data.md)** - Core specification for attaching data to a token.\n- **[PS007](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/specifications/blob/master/ps007-token-data-schema.md)** - Defines a common schema for reading token data\n\nThe following JavaScript libraries are used for working with token data:\n\n- [slp-mutable-data](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slp-mutable-data) - Core library for working with token data\n- [minimal-slp-wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimal-slp-wallet) - Contains high-level functions for reading token data.\n\n## Data Hosting\n\nThe *Genesis Data* is the only data written to the blockchain. Because only a minimal amount of data is written to the blockchain, it prevents blockchain bloat and will scale well into the future.\n\nThe *Mutable* and *Immutable* data can be hosted anywhere, but is generally hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io), a decentralized network for distributing data. The [PSF File Pinning Protocol](https://psffpp.com/docs/intro/) was specifically developed for hosting this data. It allows token data to be redundently hosted by decentralized network of computers. Hosting costs are very low.\n\n## Mutable Data\n\nMutable data is tracked by a *Mutable Data Address* (**MDA**), which is a standard Bitcoin Cash address. The transaction history of that address is used to track the data as it changes over time. This creates an immutable record of updates. Every change to the data is tracked on the blockchain. The address acts as a *pointer* to the latest data, and all the historical updates are recorded to the blockchain and can not be deleted.\n\nThe holder of the private key for that address is the only one who can update the data. This allows token creators to retain the ability to update data after the token leaves their possession. They can also pass on the private key to allow new parties to update the mutable data.",

The `psf-slp-wallet` is a command-line interface (CLI) application that allows you to create and manage these SLP tokens. While creating a basic fungible token is straightforward, attaching and managing **mutable data**, such as a token icon, involves a few more steps that empower tokens with significant functionality.\n\nThis blog post summarizes the process described in a tutorial video on creating fungible tokens with mutable data using `psf-slp-wallet`.\n\n### Understanding Key Concepts\n\nBefore diving into the steps, it's helpful to understand some core concepts related to SLP token data:\n\n*   **Genesis Data**: This is a small amount of data actually written to the blockchain when a token is created. It's fundamental to the token's existence.\n*   **Mutable Data**: This refers to data associated with a token that **can change over time**. A common use case for mutable data is adding a **token icon** for visual identification. It also allows for tracking dynamic information, like a character's stats or a product's location.\n*   **Immutable Data**: In contrast, immutable data is associated with a token but **cannot be changed** once it's set. This is often used for permanent records, such as initial creator information or design intent.\n*   **Mutable Data Address (MDA)**: This is a crucial concept. The MDA is a specific address that **controls the mutable data** for a token. Even if the token itself is sent to someone else, the creator (or anyone holding the private key for the MDA) can retain the ability to edit the token's associated mutable data. This flexibility allows for scenarios like artists enforcing royalty agreements or updating owner information for digital art. The MDA acts like a pointer, and by updating it, you can direct the token to a new version of its mutable data.\n\n### Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a Fungible Token with Rich Data\n\nTo create a fungible token with a token icon and other mutable data using `psf-slp-wallet`, follow these detailed steps:\n\n#### 1. Prepare and Fund Your Mutable Data Address (MDA) Wallet\n\nIt is considered **best practice** to use a separate wallet specifically for controlling the mutable data of each token, distinct from the wallet that will hold the tokens themselves.\n\n*   **Create a new wallet** for your MDA. For example, you can name it `MDA1`.\n    *   Command: `wallet create MDA1`\n*   **Get the address** of your newly created MDA wallet.\n    *   Command: `wallet addrs`\n*   **Fund this MDA wallet** with a small amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH) to cover transaction fees. Even 10 cents BCH is typically more than enough.\n\n#### 2. Initialize the MDA\n\nThis step creates an initial transaction on the blockchain, setting up your MDA.\n\n*   **Command**: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-mda-tx -n <MDA_Wallet_Name> -a <MDA_Address>`\n    *   Example: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-mda-tx -n MDA1 -a bitcoincash:qr2u4f2dmva6yvf3npkd5lquryp09qk7gs5vxl423h`\n*   **Record the transaction ID** of this initialization, as it will be needed later to link your token to the mutable data.\n\n#### 3. Create and Upload Your Token Icon\n\nYour token icon needs to be hosted on a network accessible by the SLP protocol, such as IPFS. The video demonstrates using [explorer.psffpp.com](https://explorer.psffpp.com) to upload and pin files.\n\n*   **Upload your token icon file** (e.g., an image) to the network. This process will provide you with an **IPFS Content ID (CID)** for your file.\n*   **Pin the file** to ensure it remains available on the network.\n*   Once pinned and accepted by the network, you'll be able to **get a URL** for your token icon. **Record this URL**.\n\n#### 4. Edit and Upload the Mutable Data File\n\nMutable data is typically stored in a **JSON file**. The video suggests [using templates available on a GitHub gist](https://gist.github.com/christroutner/d7a9b8875925ea656f512f6ba4d0084d) to simplify this process.\n\n*   **Edit the mutable data JSON template**. The most important fields for a token icon are `tokenIcon` and `fullSizedUrl`.\n    *   The `tokenIcon` is for a smaller thumbnail, while `fullSizedUrl` is for a larger image. If using the same image for both, populate both fields with the same URL.\n    *   You can also include a `about`, specify `mediaType` (e.g., image, video, music), and add any arbitrary user data in the `userData` field.\n*   **Save your edited mutable data JSON",

This will give you a new **IPFS CID** for your mutable data file.\n*   **Pin the mutable data file** and **record its IPFS CID**.\n\n#### 5. Point the MDA to the New Mutable Data\n\nThis step links your MDA to the mutable data file you just uploaded.\n\n*   **Command**: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-update -n <MDA_Wallet_Name> -c ipfs://<Mutable_Data_IPFS_CID>`\n    *   Example: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-update -n MDA1 -c ipfs://bafkreifhtcnmf577q2s5lfr46ax5qf2jnk7oy3azu5x7ceab6xajcccl3u`\n*   The `ipfs://` prefix is crucial as it tells the application that the file is on the IPFS network.\n*   This command creates a transaction on the blockchain that updates the MDA's pointer to the new mutable data. **Record this transaction ID** as your \"first mutable data update\".\n\n#### 6. (Optional but Recommended) Edit and Upload the Immutable Data File\n\nWhile optional, uploading immutable data is good practice for keeping a permanent record of your initial intentions for the token.\n\n*   **Edit an immutable data JSON template**.\n    *   You can include a timestamp, `userData`, `jsonLd` (JSON Linked Data).\n    *   It's useful to record the MDA and the initialization transaction ID from Step 2, and the first mutable data update transaction ID from Step 5 here.\n*   **Save your edited immutable data JSON file**.\n*   **Upload this JSON file** to the network and **record its IPFS CID**. You generally won't need the URL for this file directly, as it's often referenced by its CID.\n\n#### 7. Create the Fungible Token\n\nNow you can create the actual SLP token, linking it to the mutable and immutable data you prepared. It's recommended to create the token in a **separate wallet** from your MDA wallet.\n\n*   **Command**: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-create-fungible -n <Token_Wallet_Name> -m \"Token Name\" -t Ticker -d <Decimals> -q <Quantity> -u ipfs://<Immutable_Data_IPFS_CID> -h <MDA_Initialization_TxID>`\n    *   `-n`: Name of the wallet to hold the tokens.\n    *   `-m`: Full name of your token (required).\n    *   `-t`: Token ticker (required).\n    *   `-d`: Number of decimals for your token (required). Zero decimals make whole tokens that cannot be subdivided.\n    *   `-q`: Quantity of tokens to create (required).\n    *   `-u`: This flag specifies the **immutable data**. Prefix the IPFS CID of your immutable data file with `ipfs://`.\n    *   `-h`: This flag specifies the **hash that connects the token to its mutable data**. Use the **transaction ID from your MDA initialization** (from Step 2) here. This acts as a \"breadcrumb trail\" that the protocol follows to find the latest mutable data.\n    *   Example: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-create-fungible -n tokens1 -m \"M test one\" -t MTEST -d 0 -q 1000 -u ipfs://<Immutable_Data_IPFS_CID> -h <MDA_Initialization_TxID>`\n\n#### 8. Verify and Use Your Token\n\nAfter creation, you can check your token balance in the specified wallet. You can also send tokens to a web wallet, such as [wallet.psfoundation.info](https://wallet.psfoundation.info), to observe them. Due to the decentralized nature of the network, it might take a few minutes for the token icon and other information to fully propagate and display.\n\n### Updating Mutable Data After Token Creation\n\nOne of the powerful features of SLP tokens with mutable data is the ability to **update that data even after the token has been created and transferred**. This process is similar to how you initially pointed your MDA to the mutable data.\n\nTo update the mutable data (e.g., changing the token icon):\n\n1.  **Create or modify your new token icon**.\n2.  **Upload the new token icon** to the network and obtain its new IPFS CID and URL.\n3.  **Edit your mutable data JSON file** to reflect the new token icon URL. Remember to save this file.\n4.  **Upload the updated mutable data JSON file** to the network, obtaining its new IPFS CID.\n5.  **Use the `token-update` command again** to point your MDA to this new mutable data file.\n    *   Command: `node psf-slp-wallet.js token-update -n <MDA_Wallet_Name> -c ipfs://<New_Mutable_Data_IPFS_CID>`\n    *   Remember",

Once the transaction is confirmed, wallets reading the token's data will automatically display the updated information, such as the new token icon.\n\nA key advantage of this system is that **all past updates remain recorded on the blockchain**, creating an immutable, auditable record of changes to the token's mutable data over time.\n\n### A Simpler Alternative\n\nThe process described above involves several technical steps. If this seems too complex, an alternative exists: [TokenTiger.com](https://tokentiger.com). As of the video's recording, TokenTiger did not support fungible tokens but was working on it. It provides a more user-friendly interface that hides much of the underlying complexity.",

This is the most comprehensive software for creating and managing tokens. You can create all types (Type 1, 65, 128) of SLP tokens, can mint them, can attach data to them, and can manage multiple wallets.\n\n- [psf-slp-wallet GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet)\n\n<iframe width=\"639\" height=\"359\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjgeUIWekoA\" title=\"The Easiest Way to Make NFTs\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n---\n\n# Getting Started with PSF SLP Wallet: Create Your First Fungible Token\n\nIf you're looking to create and manage SLP (Simple Ledger Protocol) tokens from the command line, the [PSF SLP Wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet) is a powerful and easy-to-use tool. In this guide, we’ll walk through installing the wallet, creating a fungible token, and sending it to a token-aware wallet—all from scratch on a brand new Ubuntu 20 system. The process also works on Windows and macOS.\n\n\n## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\n\nYou'll need a terminal environment to run the wallet. This could be:\n\n- Ubuntu (or another Linux distro)\n- Windows PowerShell\n- macOS Terminal\n- VS Code terminal on any platform\n\nBefore you begin:\n\n- **Install Node.js** (v20.9 used in the video, but newer versions should work)\n- **Install npm** (Node Package Manager)\n\nTo verify installation:\n\n```bash\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Clone the Wallet Repository\n\nClone the open-source PSF SLP Wallet from GitHub:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet\ncd psf-slp-wallet\nnpm install\n```\n\nOnce installed, you can check available commands:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js --help\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Create a Wallet\n\nCreate a new wallet using:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-create -n wallet1 -d \"Test Wallet 1\"\n```\n\nYou can list all wallets:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-list\n```\n\nAnd view the addresses:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-addrs -n wallet1\n```\n\nTake note of the **Bitcoin Cash (bitcoincash:)** address. You’ll need it to fund the wallet.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Fund the Wallet\n\nTo create tokens, your wallet needs a small amount of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)—a few cents is sufficient.\n\nOne quick way to fund the wallet is by using the [web wallet](https://wallet.psfoundation.info), which will generate a BCH wallet you can use to send funds. Transfer ~$0.10 worth of BCH to your new wallet's address.\n\nAfter funding, check your balance:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-balance -n wallet1\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Create a Fungible Token\n\nUse this command to create a basic fungible token:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js token-create-fungible \\\n  -n wallet1 \\\n  -m test1 \\\n  -t test1 \\\n  -d 2 \\\n  -q 100\n```\n\nThis creates 100 tokens with 2 decimal places, allowing fractional amounts like `1.00`, `0.50`, or `0.01`.\n\nYou can confirm creation by viewing the blockchain record (a link will be printed in the console) or checking your balance again:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js wallet-balance -n wallet1\n```\n\nTake note of the **Token ID** from your balance output—it's required to send the token.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Send Tokens to Another Wallet\n\nTo send tokens, first get a **Simple Ledger address** from a token-aware wallet like the [PSF Web Wallet](https://wallet.psfoundation.info). Toggle to “SLP mode” to see the correct address.\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nnode psf-slp-wallet.js send-tokens \\\n  -n wallet1 \\\n  -t [your-token-id] \\\n  -q 100 \\\n  -a [receiver simpledger: address]\n```\n\nYour tokens should now appear in the recipient's wallet. Always use **token-aware wallets** to avoid accidentally burning tokens.\n\n---\n\n## What’s Next?\n\nThis walkthrough showed how to:\n\n- Install the [PSF SLP Wallet](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/psf-slp-wallet) \n- Create a fungible token  \n- Send it to another wallet\n\nFuture tutorials will cover:\n\n- Attaching **mutable** and **immutable data**\n- Adding **token icons**\n- Creating **NFTs and NFT groups**\n\nStay tuned for more advanced features!",

The process outlined involves four steps using the website [TokenTiger.com](https://tokentiger.com).\n\nHere are the steps:\n1.  **Create an account at tokentiger.com**. You only need an email and a password to sign up. After signing up and logging in, you will see a gallery page of recently created tokens.\n2.  **Get free credit**. You can do this by clicking on the \"zero credits\" area. There are two methods to get free credit: email verification or Telegram verification using a Telegram bot. Once verified, you can claim your free credit.\n3.  **Go to the \"create\" section**. You can use an image, a zip file, or a PDF file to tokenize. In the example shown, an image created with AI art was used.\n    *   When using an image, the token icon is automatically created as a smaller version of the image, although you have the option to upload a different token icon.\n    *   There is a toggle option: **\"make NFT payload public\"**.\n        *   If left private (off), someone who receives or buys the token and brings it back to tokentiger can burn the token in exchange for a copy of the file (like the image). This is a common use case for selling digital downloads.\n        *   If made public (on), the image itself will be put on IPFS and will be publicly accessible. This use case is more suitable for displaying and sharing artwork.\n4.  **Name the NFT and create it**. You can provide a name for the token. In the example, the document URL was left pointing to tokentiger for demonstration. After setting the details, you click \"create\".\n\nThe process of generating the token takes a couple of minutes. Once created, you can click a link to see the token on a blockchain explorer. The token will then appear in your collection on tokentiger.com. The source notes that the image may take a few minutes to be pinned and show up. Once the token is in your collection, you can interact with it using icons at the bottom.",

So, yes, any SLP UTXO can also be a Script Bitcoin contract. The only requirement is that the Script output an OP_RETURN with valid SLP encoding in the transactions first output. In practice, this is pretty cumbersome and bugs can lead to tokens being burned.\n\nA different way to create a 'smart contract' would be to drop some high-level code into the tokens Mutable Data. Then the user can use the token like a program, by interacting with an app that looks for those kinds of SLP tokens. It's a much higher-level approach and is not dependent on Bitcoin Script in any way.",

This is **always present for confirmed transactions**.\n- `time`: When using RPC methods like `getrawtransaction` with `verbose=true`, this typically refers to **the same block time** as blocktime for confirmed transactions. However, if a transaction is still in the mempool (i.e., not yet mined), `time` refers to **when it entered the mempool**, and blocktime will be absent or null.\n\nKeep in mind, that Bitcoin is a decentralized network, so the nodes on the network can not be synced perfectly with time. Block height is used as a replacement for time in the Bitcoin system. \n\n```javascript\nconst timestamp = new Date(1675532168 * 1000)\nconsole.log('timestamp: ', timestamp)\n// timestamp:  2023-02-04T17:36:08.000Z\n```",

WIF is a standard way to represent a private key.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // mainnet WIF\n    let wif = 'L4vmKsStbQaCvaKPnCzdRArZgdAxTqVx8vjMGLW5nHtWdRguiRi1';\n    let ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromWIF(wif);\n\n    // testnet WIF\n    wif = 'cSNLj6xeg3Yg2rfcgKoWNx4MiAgn9ugCUUro37UDEhn6CzeYqjWW'\n    ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromWIF(wif);\n    ```\n* **`toWIF(ecpair)`**:  Given an ECPair, this function retrieves the private key in WIF format.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // mainnet wif\n    let wif = 'L4vmKsStbQaCvaKPnCzdRArZgdAxTqVx8vjMGLW5nHtWdRguiRi1';\n    // ecpair from wif\n    let ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromWIF(wif);\n    // wif from ecpair\n    let wifFromECPair = bchjs.ECPair.toWIF(ecpair);\n    console.log(wifFromECPair); // Output: L4vmKsStbQaCvaKPnCzdRArZgdAxTqVx8vjMGLW5nHtWdRguiRi1\n    ```\n* **`fromPublicKey(pubkeyBuffer)`**:  You can create an ECPair directly from a public key (represented as a Buffer).\n\n    ```javascript\n    // create ECPair from mainnet pubkeyBuffer\n    let pubkeyBuffer = Buffer.from(\"02fb721b92025e775b1b84774e65d568d24645cb633275f5c26f5c3101b214a8fb\", 'hex');\n    let ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromPublicKey(pubkeyBuffer);\n    ```\n* **`toPublicKey(ecpair)`**:  This function extracts the public key (as a Buffer) from an ECPair.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // create ecpair from mainnet public key buffer\n    let ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromPublicKey(Buffer.from('02d305772e0873fba6c1c7ff353ce374233316eb5820acd7ff3d7d9b82d514126b', 'hex'));\n    // create public key buffer\n    let publicKeyBuffer = bchjs.ECPair.toPublicKey(ecpair);\n    console.log(publicKeyBuffer);\n    ```\n* **`toLegacyAddress(ecpair)`**:  ECPair can provide the older \"legacy\" Bitcoin Cash address format.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // mainnet wif\n    let wif = 'L5GPEGxCmojgzFoBLUUqT2GegLGqobiYhTZzfLtpkLTfTb9E9NRn';\n    // ecpair from wif\n    let ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromWIF(wif);\n    // to legacy address\n    let legacyAddress = bchjs.ECPair.toLegacyAddress(ecpair);\n    console.log(legacyAddress); // Output: 1DgxdA5bbMcCNWg3yB2MgKqFazV92BXgxK\n    ```\n* **`toCashAddress(ecpair, regtest = false)`**:  ECPair generates the modern Cash Address format, which is the standard for Bitcoin Cash.\n\n    ```javascript\n    // mainnet wif\n    let wif = 'L5GPEGxCmojgzFoBLUUqT2GegLGqobiYhTZzfLtpkLTfTb9E9NRn';\n    // ecpair from wif\n    let ecpair = bchjs.ECPair.fromWIF(wif);\n    // to cash address\n    let cashAddress = bchjs.ECPair.toCashAddress(ecpair);\n    console.log(cashAddress); // Output: bitcoincash:qz9nq206kteyv2t7trhdr4vzzkej60kqtytn7sxkxm\n    ```\n\n**Why is this important?**\n\nECPairs are essential for managing Bitcoin Cash wallets and making transactions.  `bch-js` simplifies the process of creating, storing, and using these key pairs.",

The constructor accepts an optional mnemonic or WIF key and an options object.\n\n```javascript\n// Import the library (Node.js example)\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\n// --- Basic Instantiation (Creates a NEW wallet) ---\nconst bchWallet = new BchWallet();\n\n// --- Instantiation with Options ---\n\n// Option 1: Using Web 2 REST API (e.g., FullStack.cash)\nconst walletWithOptionsRest = new BchWallet(undefined, { // 'undefined' creates a new wallet\n  interface: 'rest-api',\n  restURL: 'https://api.fullstack.cash/v5/' // Example API endpoint\n});\n\n// Option 2: Using Web 3 Consumer API (e.g., free-bch.fullstack.cash or local consumer)\nconst walletWithOptionsWeb3 = new BchWallet(undefined, {\n  interface: 'consumer-api',\n  restURL: 'https://free-bch.fullstack.cash' // Example public consumer endpoint\n  // Or connect to your own instance: restURL: 'http://localhost:5005'\n});\n\n// Option 3: Using an existing mnemonic or WIF\nconst existingMnemonic = 'minor bench until split suffer shine series bag avoid cruel orient aunt';\nconst walletFromMnemonic = new BchWallet(existingMnemonic);\n\nconst existingWif = 'L3BUek8oq1iijZTkfdRYo8RDxEe3PpB8MyJnh2FSGWAoCjAffQCp';\nconst walletFromWif = new BchWallet(existingWif);\n```\n\n**Important Initialization Steps**\n\nAfter creating an instance, two asynchronous operations need to complete:\n\n1.  **`walletInfoPromise`:** This promise resolves almost instantly once the basic wallet information (keys, address) is generated or derived. You *must* await this before accessing `walletInfo`.\n2.  **`initialize()`:** This method connects to the network (using the specified interface) to fetch the wallet's UTXOs, balance, and token information. It's essential for wallets with existing history but can be skipped for brand new, empty wallets.\n\n```javascript\nasync function setupWallet() {\n  const bchWallet = new BchWallet(undefined, { // Using default REST API\n      interface: 'rest-api'\n  });\n\n  // 1. Wait for basic wallet info to be generated\n  await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n  console.log(\"Wallet Info Ready:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n\n  // 2. Initialize network state (balances, UTXOs, tokens)\n  // This step is crucial for wallets that might have funds or history.\n  try {\n    await bchWallet.initialize();\n    console.log(\"Wallet Initialized Successfully!\");\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Initialization failed:\", err);\n    // Handle cases where the wallet is new or network fails\n  }\n\n  // Now the wallet instance is fully ready to use!\n  // Example: Get balance (requires initialization)\n  try {\n     const balance = await bchWallet.getBalance();\n     console.log(`Balance: ${balance} satoshis`);\n  } catch(initErr) {\n     console.error(\"Could not get balance. Was the wallet initialized?\", initErr);\n  }\n}\n\nsetupWallet();\n```\n\nWith installation and initialization covered, we'll dive into creating and managing wallets in the next post.",

It powers applications like the `bch-wallet-web3-android` app and the `psf-bch-wallet` command-line tool.\n\n**Infrastructure Flexibility**\n\nOne of the key features is its ability to connect to different backend infrastructures:\n\n1.  **Web 2 (REST API):** Connects to traditional REST APIs like those provided by FullStack.cash.\n2.  **Web 3 (Consumer API):** Interacts with decentralized infrastructure via the `bch-consumer` library, enabling communication with services like the Cash Stack.\n\nIn the next post, we'll cover how to install and set up the library in your project.",

    "content": "### Creating and Managing Wallets\n\nThis post focuses on creating new wallets, importing existing ones, and securely managing your wallet keys using `minimal-slp-wallet`.\n\n**Creating a New Wallet**\n\nCreating a new wallet is straightforward. Simply instantiate the `BchWallet` class without providing a mnemonic or WIF key.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function createNewWallet() {\n  const bchWallet = new BchWallet();\n\n  // Wait for the wallet details to be generated\n  await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  console.log(\"New Wallet Created!\");\n  console.log(\"Mnemonic:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.mnemonic); // Keep this safe!\n  console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n  console.log(\"SLP Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.slpAddress);\n  console.log(\"Private Key (WIF):\", bchWallet.walletInfo.privateKey); // Keep this safe!\n  console.log(\"Derivation Path:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.hdPath); // Default: m/44'/245'/0'/0/0\n}\n\ncreateNewWallet();\n```\nThe `walletInfo` object holds all the critical details. **Remember to securely back up the mnemonic phrase!**\n\n**Importing Existing Wallets**\n\nYou can initialize the wallet from an existing 12-word mnemonic phrase or a WIF (Wallet Import Format) private key.\n\n* **From Mnemonic:**\n    ```javascript\n    const BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\n    async function importFromMnemonic() {\n      const mnemonic = 'minor bench until split suffer shine series bag avoid cruel orient aunt'; // Replace with your mnemonic\n      const bchWallet = new BchWallet(mnemonic);\n\n      await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n      console.log(\"Wallet Imported from Mnemonic:\");\n      console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n      console.log(\"Private Key (WIF):\", bchWallet.walletInfo.privateKey);\n    }\n\n    importFromMnemonic();\n    ```\n\n* **From WIF:** WIF keys typically start with 'K' or 'L'.\n    ```javascript\n    const BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\n    async function importFromWif() {\n      const wif = 'L3BUek8oq1iijZTkfdRYo8RDxEe3PpB8MyJnh2FSGWAoCjAffQCp'; // Replace with your WIF\n      const bchWallet = new BchWallet(wif);\n\n      await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n      console.log(\"Wallet Imported from WIF:\");\n      console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n      console.log(\"Private Key (WIF):\", bchWallet.walletInfo.privateKey); // Same as input WIF\n      console.log(\"Mnemonic:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.mnemonic); // Will be null when importing from WIF\n    }\n\n    importFromWif();\n    ```\n\n**Changing the Derivation Path**\n\nBy default, the library uses the standard SLP path `m/44'/245'/0'/0/0`. You can specify a different HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) path during instantiation if needed.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function useDifferentPath() {\n    const mnemonic = 'minor bench until split suffer shine series bag avoid cruel orient aunt';\n    const customPath = \"m/44'/245'/0'/1'\"; // Example: First derived address on second account\n\n    const bchWallet = new BchWallet(mnemonic, {\n        hdPath: customPath\n    });\n\n    await bchWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n\n    console.log(`Wallet using path ${bchWallet.walletInfo.hdPath}:`);\n    console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWallet.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n}\n\nuseDifferentPath();\n```\n\n**Encrypting and Decrypting Mnemonics**\n\nFor added security, especially when storing mnemonics (e.g., in browser `localStorage`), you can encrypt them with a password.\n\n```javascript\nconst BchWallet = require('minimal-slp-wallet');\n\nasync function manageEncryptedWallet() {\n  const password = 'yourStrongPassword!'; // Use a strong, unique password\n\n  // 1. Create a new wallet with encryption enabled\n  const bchWalletEncrypt = new BchWallet(null, { // 'null' or 'undefined' creates a new wallet\n    password: password\n  });\n  await bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  console.log(\"Original Mnemonic:\", bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfo.mnemonic);\n  console.log(\"Encrypted Mnemonic:\", bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfo.mnemonicEncrypted); // Store this encrypted version\n\n  // --- Later, when retrieving the wallet ---\n\n  // 2. Instantiate the wallet using the encrypted mnemonic and password\n  const encryptedMnemonicFromStorage = bchWalletEncrypt.walletInfo.mnemonicEncrypted; // Retrieve this\n  const bchWalletDecrypt = new BchWallet(encryptedMnemonicFromStorage, {\n    password: password\n  });\n  await bchWalletDecrypt.walletInfoPromise;\n\n  console.log(\"Decrypted Mnemonic:\", bchWalletDecrypt.walletInfo.mnemonic);\n  console.log(\"Cash Address:\", bchWalletDecrypt.walletInfo.cashAddress);\n\n  // Trying with the wrong password will throw an error during instantiation\n  try {\n      const wrongPasswordWallet = new BchWallet(encryptedMnemonicFromStorage, {\n          password: 'wrongPassword'\n      });\n      await wrongPasswordWallet.walletInfoPromise;\n  } catch (err) {\n      console.error(\"Decryption failed (expected):\", err.message); // Should say 'Wrong password'\n  }\n}\n\nmanageEncrypted",

Send a small amount of BCH (0.0001 or more) to the address\n  saved in the `wallet.json` file generated by this app. All other example apps\n  read this `wallet.json` file.\n\n- [check-token-balance](check-token-balance) Check the token balance of your\nBCH wallet for a single tokenId\n\n- [check-balances](check-balances) Check the balance of your BCH wallet. This\n  displays both BCH information as well as SLP token information.\n\n## SLP Token Functions\n\n- [create-token](create-token) - Create a new SLP token class. Run the\n  [create-wallet](create-wallet) example first, and fund your wallet with a few\n  cents of BCH first.\n\n- [create-nft](create-nft) - Create a new SLP\n[non-fungible token](https://coincentral.com/nfts-non-fungible-tokens/). Run the\n[create-wallet](create-wallet) example first, and fund your wallet with a few\ncents of BCH first.\n\n- [mint-token](mint-token) - Mint additional SLP tokens for an existing class\n  controlled by your wallet.\n\n- [send-token](send-token) - Send tokens from your address to another address.\n\n- [burn-all](burn-all) - Burn all tokens for an address by tokenId.\n\n- [lookup-token](lookup-token) - Lookup token information based on the token `id`.\n\n- [list-all-tokens](list-all-tokens) - List every token in existence.\n\n- [conversion](conversion) - Convert between address formats.",

    "content": "# Non Fungable Tokens (NFT)\n\nThe examples in this directory show how to generate and work with Non-fugable\nTokens (NFTs) using the [NFT1 Specification](https://github.com/simpleledger/slp-specifications/blob/master/slp-nft-1.md).\n\n- [This YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvlpYUx6HRs) walks through the examples in this folder.\n\n## NFT Workflow\n![nft-example.jpg](nft-example.jpg)\n\nThe workflow of NFT tokens using SLP and the BCH blockchain can be non-intuitive. The image above is an example of the workflow. Here are the steps to generating an NFT token:\n\n1. An NFT 'Group' token is created first. This is not an NFT itself, but the raw ingredient from which an NFT is created. This is analogous to a stem cell, which is a cell that has not yet chosen to be a specific type of cell (like bone, blood, or nerve cell), but has the potential to become any of them.\n\n2. NFT Group tokens can be created, minted, and sent just like any other kind of SLP token. The reason these are called a 'Group' token is that they represent a class or group of NFTs. So a Group might represent a class of items like swords, paintings, or concert tickets.\n\n3. A NFT Child token is generated by consuming an NFT Group token. NFT Children are the actual NFT tokens and represent specific things with that class, like Excalibur (a sword), the Mona Lisa (a painting), and Row B seat 24 (a concert ticket).\n\n4. NFT Children can be created and sent, but they can not be minted like other SLP tokens.\n\n## Examples\nThe following workflow is recommended for working your way through the examples in order to learn about working with NFT tokens:\n\n- [Create an NFT Group token](./create-nft-group)\n- [Send an NFT Group token](./send-group)\n- [Create an NFT Child by consuming an NFT Group token.](./create-nft-child)\n- [Send an NFT Child token](./send-child)\n- [Mint another NFT Group token in order to create more NFT Child tokens.](./mint-nft-group)",
