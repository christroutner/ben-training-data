## Getting Started with Bitcoin Core

To begin using Bitcoin Core, you need to download and install it from the official [Bitcoin Core website](https://bitcoincore.org). The installation process varies depending on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), but it generally involves downloading a binary file and running it.

Once installed, Bitcoin Core runs as a background service, synchronizing with the Bitcoin network. This synchronization can take several hours or days, as the node downloads the entire blockchain from peers in the network. During this process, your node verifies every transaction and block according to the Bitcoin protocol rules.

After synchronization, you can use Bitcoin Core to send and receive bitcoins, verify transactions, and interact with the blockchain through its command-line interface (CLI). For developers, Bitcoin Core also provides APIs for integrating Bitcoin functionality into custom applications.
