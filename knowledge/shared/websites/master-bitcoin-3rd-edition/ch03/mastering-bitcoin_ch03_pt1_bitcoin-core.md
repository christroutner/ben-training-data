# Introduction to Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation of the Bitcoin protocol. It provides a full-node client that allows users to interact directly with the Bitcoin network without relying on third-party services. This chapter introduces the core concepts of Bitcoin Core, including its architecture, key features, and how it enables direct interaction with the blockchain.

Bitcoin Core is designed to be a secure and reliable way to manage Bitcoin transactions. It verifies all transactions according to the Bitcoin protocol rules, ensuring that your funds are protected by cryptographic principles. By running Bitcoin Core, you gain full control over your bitcoins and can verify the validity of any transaction or block on the network.

The reference implementation also includes tools for developers and users to interact with the blockchain programmatically. This makes it a powerful tool for building custom applications or scripts that integrate Bitcoin functionality.
