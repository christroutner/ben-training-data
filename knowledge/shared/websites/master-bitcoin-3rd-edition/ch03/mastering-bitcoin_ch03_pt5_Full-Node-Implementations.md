## Full-Node Implementations

A full-node implementation of Bitcoin runs a complete copy of the blockchain and validates all transactions itself. This ensures that you have full control over your bitcoins and do not rely on third-party services for verification.

Bitcoin Core is one of the most well-known full-node implementations, but there are others available. For example:
- **Electron Cash**: A lightweight implementation for users who want to run a Bitcoin node without downloading the entire blockchain.
- **LTC Core**: The reference implementation for Litecoin, which follows a similar architecture to Bitcoin Core.

This chapter discusses the importance of running full-node implementations and introduces some alternative projects that provide similar functionality.
