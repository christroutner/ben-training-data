## Development Pipeline Using Test Blockchains

Bitcoin's various blockchains (regtest, signet, testnet3, mainnet) offer a progression of testing environments that form a development pipeline for Bitcoin applications. This pipeline works whether you're developing for Bitcoin Core, another full-node client, a wallet, an exchange, an e-commerce site, or even novel smart contracts.

The recommended approach is to start development and initial testing locally on regtest, where you have complete control over the environment and can rapidly generate blocks and transactions. Once your code functions as expected in this controlled setting, move to signet or testnet to expose it to a more dynamic public network with diverse code and applications.

After thorough testing in these public test environments confirms your code's stability and security, you can finally deploy to mainnet for production use. As you make improvements, fix bugs, or add features, restart this pipeline - testing changes first on regtest, then signet or testnet, before deploying to production. This methodology ensures thorough testing at each stage while minimizing risks to users and the Bitcoin network.
