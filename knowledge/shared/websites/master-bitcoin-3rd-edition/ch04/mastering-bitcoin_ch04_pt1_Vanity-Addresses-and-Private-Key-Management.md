### Vanity Addresses and Private Key Management
Vanity addresses are custom Bitcoin addresses derived from specific private keys or key tweaks. While they can be created using vanity generators, they are not compatible with deterministic wallets unless additional backup data is stored for each address. This makes them impractical for most users relying on modern wallet software.

Reusing a vanity address for multiple transactions reduces privacy by linking all payments to the same address. This could expose sensitive information about donors or customers, making it less ideal for scenarios requiring anonymity or privacy protection.
