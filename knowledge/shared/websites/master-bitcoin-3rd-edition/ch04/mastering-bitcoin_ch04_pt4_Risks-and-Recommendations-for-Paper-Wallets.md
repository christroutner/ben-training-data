### Risks and Recommendations for Paper Wallets
The use of paper wallets is discouraged unless absolutely necessary, and even then, extreme caution must be exercised. Users should avoid generating them using untrusted software or sharing the private keys in digital formats.

For secure backups, recovery codes combined with hardware signing devices are recommended over traditional paper wallets. These methods provide better protection against theft and environmental hazards while maintaining access to funds through deterministic key generation.
