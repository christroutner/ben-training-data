## Hashrate Attacks and Consensus Vulnerabilities

Bitcoin's consensus mechanism is theoretically vulnerable to attacks by miners who control significant hashing power. The most well-known is the "51% attack" or "majority attack," where a group controlling the majority of the network's hashing power could cause deliberate forks and double-spend transactions.

In a double-spend attack, the attacker creates a transaction, waits for it to be confirmed, receives the product or service, then mines an alternative chain that replaces the original transaction with one sending the same coins back to themselves. With sufficient hashing power, attackers could invalidate six or more confirmations, undermining transactions previously considered immutable.

To protect against such attacks, merchants selling high-value items should wait for at least six confirmations before delivering products or use multisignature escrow accounts. The more confirmations that pass, the harder it becomes to invalidate a transaction through blockchain reorganization.

Other potential attacks include denying service to specific addresses by censoring their transactions. If included in blocks mined by others, the attacker could deliberately fork and remine those blocks while excluding the targeted transactions.

Although called a "51% attack," such attacks might be possible with less hashing power, possibly as little as 30% according to some research. The risk is amplified by mining pool centralization, where pool operators control block construction and transaction inclusion. Even without profit motives, well-funded attackers could launch disruptive attacks on the network.
