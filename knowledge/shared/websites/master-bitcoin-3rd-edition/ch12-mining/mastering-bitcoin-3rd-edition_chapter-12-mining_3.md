## Decentralized Consensus Mechanism

Bitcoin's decentralized consensus mechanism allows everyone in the network to agree on a single "truth" about ownership without trusting anyone. Unlike traditional payment systems that rely on central authorities, Bitcoin's blockchain is assembled independently by every node in the network.

This consensus emerges from four processes that occur independently across the network:
1. Independent verification of each transaction by every full node
2. Independent aggregation of transactions into new blocks by miners
3. Independent verification of new blocks by every node
4. Independent selection by every node of the chain with the most cumulative proof of work

Each node verifies transactions against a comprehensive checklist before propagating them through the network. This verification ensures only valid transactions are propagated, while invalid ones are discarded at the first encountering node. The criteria include correct syntax, proper input and output values, valid signatures, and confirmation that inputs being spent match unspent outputs in previous blocks.

Through independent verification, each node builds a pool of valid but unconfirmed transactions known as the memory pool or mempool. This verification process is crucial for the integrity of the Bitcoin network.
