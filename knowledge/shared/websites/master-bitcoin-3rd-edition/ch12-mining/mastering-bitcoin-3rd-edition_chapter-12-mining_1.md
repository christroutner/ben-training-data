# Mining and Consensus in Bitcoin

## The Purpose of Mining

Mining is the mechanism that underpins Bitcoin's decentralized clearinghouse, enabling transaction validation and consensus without central authority. While miners are incentivized by rewards of new bitcoins, mining's primary purpose is securing the Bitcoin system and enabling network-wide consensus in a decentralized manner.

Miners record new transactions on the global blockchain, with a new block being mined approximately every 10 minutes. Transactions included in a block and added to the blockchain are considered confirmed. This confirmation process creates a topological order of transactions in the blockchain, ensuring that no two valid transactions can spend the same output, thus eliminating double-spending.

Miners receive two types of rewards: new bitcoins created with each block (the subsidy) and transaction fees from all transactions included in the block. To earn these rewards, miners compete to solve a cryptographic hash algorithm challenge. The reward decreases approximately every four years, halving from 50 bitcoins initially to 6.25 bitcoins after May 2020. After approximately 2140, no new bitcoins will be created, and miners will be incentivized solely by transaction fees.
