## Mining Competition and Pools

Bitcoin mining has become extremely competitive, with hashing power increasing exponentially every year. The industry has evolved from CPU mining to GPU mining, then to FPGA mining, and eventually to ASIC mining with specialized chips. This evolution has dramatically increased the network's computational power.

As mining difficulty increased, individual miners (solo miners) found it increasingly challenging to discover blocks frequently enough to earn consistent rewards. This led to the development of mining pools, where miners collaborate to find blocks and share rewards proportionally to their contributed work.

Mining pools coordinate thousands of miners through specialized protocols. The miners configure their equipment to connect to a pool server, and their hardware remains connected while mining. When the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is paid to a pool Bitcoin address and then distributed to miners based on their contribution.

To measure individual contributions fairly, pools use the proof-of-work algorithm with a lower difficulty setting (higher target). Miners earn "shares" when they find hash values below the pool target, even if these values aren't low enough to create a valid block. These shares prove the miner's work contribution, and when someone in the pool finds a block that meets the Bitcoin network target, the reward is distributed proportionally based on shares.

There are two main types of mining pools:
1. Managed pools run by pool operators who charge a percentage fee
2. Peer-to-peer mining pools (P2Pool) that operate without central operators using a "share chain"
