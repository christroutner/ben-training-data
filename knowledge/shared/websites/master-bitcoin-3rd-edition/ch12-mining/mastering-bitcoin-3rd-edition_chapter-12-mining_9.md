## Mining Process and Block Validation

When a mining node constructs a candidate block, specialized hardware (ASICs) begins testing trillions of variations of the header per second. Because the 32-bit nonce only allows 4 billion possibilities, miners may also adjust other parameters like the coinbase extra nonce space, versionbits, or timestamp when they exhaust the nonce range.

Once a solution is found, the mining node immediately transmits the block to its peers. Each receiving node validates the block against strict criteria before adding it to their blockchain. The validation ensures that only blocks following consensus rules are incorporated, thus maintaining the integrity of the system.

The validation checklist includes verifying that:
- The block structure is syntactically valid
- The block header hash is less than the target
- The block timestamp is within acceptable limits
- The first transaction is a coinbase transaction
- All transactions within the block are valid

This independent validation by every node ensures miners cannot cheat by creating invalid blocks or claiming incorrect rewards. If a miner tried to award themselves more bitcoins than allowed, their block would be rejected by the network, wasting their mining effort.
