## Constructing the Block Header

To construct a block header, a mining node needs to fill in six fields: Version, Previous Block Hash, Merkle Root, Timestamp, Target, and Nonce. The version field was originally an integer but later defined as a bitfield (versionbits) allowing up to 29 upgrades to be in progress simultaneously.

The Previous Block Hash references the hash of the parent block, committing the miner's power to extending the specific chain ending with that block. The Merkle Root is calculated by summarizing all transactions in the block into one 32-byte value through a merkle tree process.

The timestamp is encoded as a Unix epoch timestamp, while the Target field represents the difficulty requirement for the proof-of-work. The final field, Nonce, is initially set to zero and will be incremented during the mining process.

With all these fields filled, the header of the candidate block is complete, and the mining process can begin. The goal is to find a header that produces a hash less than the target value, which requires testing billions or trillions of variations by adjusting the nonce or other parameters.
