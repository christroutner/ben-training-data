## Paper Wallets and Key Management

Paper wallets are physical documents containing printed Bitcoin private keys, often including the corresponding addresses for convenience. While once popular as a cold storage method, they are now considered obsolete and dangerous for several reasons:

1. The software generating paper wallets might be compromised
2. They create single points of failure
3. They don't fit well with modern wallet recovery systems
4. They encourage address reuse
5. Many users don't properly understand how to securely create, store, and use them

Modern best practices recommend using deterministic wallets with recovery seed phrases, possibly combined with hardware signing devices for enhanced security. This approach provides better protection against physical damage, theft, and user error compared to paper wallets.

The evolution of Bitcoin addresses from simple public keys to complex script commitments reflects the protocol's development toward greater efficiency, security, and privacy. With each innovation, from hash-based commitments to bech32m encoding, Bitcoin has improved how users can reliably and securely receive funds while preparing for future protocol enhancements.
