## Transaction Versioning
Bitcoin transactions have a version field that determines how they are interpreted by the network. The original version (v1) was used until BIP68 introduced version 2, which added constraints on the sequence field for transactions with version â‰¥2. Version 2 transactions must follow new rules to enhance security and reliability.
