## RGB Protocol

RGB is a colored coins protocol that pioneered many concepts used in modern Bitcoin-based colored coin implementations. It was designed to be compatible with off-chain payment channels, including those used in Lightning Network. RGB implements single-use seals by assigning colored coins to a UTXO that requires signatures from both parties to spend, serving as the mechanism for future transfers.

The protocol utilizes Pay to Contract (P2C) allowing parties to sign multiple versions of contracts. When used with payment channels, this ensures that only the latest version of the contract is published on-chain. Client-side validation is implemented so that participants don't need to trust each other - they each verify all previous transfers back to creation to ensure contract rules were followed correctly.

RGB has broader applications beyond asset transfers, such as creating identity tokens that can be periodically updated to protect against private key compromise. Its design focuses on privacy, compatibility with payment channels, and maintaining the trustless nature of Bitcoin while expanding functionality.
