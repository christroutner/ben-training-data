## Compiling Bitcoin Core from Source Code

Bitcoin Core's source code can be obtained either by downloading an archive from the official website or by cloning the GitHub repository. To clone the repository, use the `git` command:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin.git
Cloning into 'bitcoin'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 245912, done.
...
$ cd bitcoin
```

After cloning, you should select a specific release version rather than using the default latest code which might be an unstable or beta version. List available release tags using `git tag` and then check out the desired stable version:

```
$ git tag
v0.1.5
...
v24.0.1
...
$ git checkout v24.0.1
```

The build process begins with the `autogen.sh` script which generates build scripts appropriate for your system:

```
$ ./autogen.sh
```

Next, run the `configure` script to customize the build process. You can view available options with `./configure --help`. Common configuration options include:

- `--prefix=$HOME`: Install in your home directory instead of system-wide
- `--disable-wallet`: Skip the wallet implementation
- `--with-incompatible-bdb`: Allow incompatible Berkeley DB versions for wallets
- `--with-gui=no`: Build only the command-line tools without the GUI

After configuration, compile the code using `make`, verify with `make check`, and install with `make install`:

```
$ make
$ make check
$ sudo make install
```

The default installation puts executables in `/usr/local/bin`, which you can verify with:

```
$ which bitcoind
/usr/local/bin/bitcoind
```
