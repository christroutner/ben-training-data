## From Bitcoin to Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin began as Satoshi Nakamoto's implementation, which was completed before the whitepaper's publication to ensure it worked properly. This original software evolved into what is now called Bitcoin Core to differentiate it from other implementations. As an open source project under the MIT license, Bitcoin's code is freely available to download and use for any purpose.

The Bitcoin Core project has grown substantially since its inception. By 2023, it had over 1,000 contributors, with around a dozen developers working nearly full-time and several dozen more contributing part-time. Bitcoin Core implements all aspects of the technology, including wallets, transaction and block validation, block construction tools, and all modern peer-to-peer communication protocols.

While Bitcoin Core serves as the reference implementation, many system aspects introduced after 2011 are documented in Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs). These specifications provide standardized documentation for major upgrades and technical implementations that extend beyond the original whitepaper.
