## Running a Bitcoin Core Node

Bitcoin's peer-to-peer network consists of nodes run by individuals and businesses. Running your own node provides an authoritative view of the blockchain with local verification of all transactions. This gives you independence from third parties and helps strengthen the overall network.

Running a node requires substantial resources: initially downloading over 500 GB of data, processing about 400 MB of transactions daily (as of 2023), and requiring at least 1 TB of disk space for long-term operation. If your internet connection has bandwidth limitations or data caps, you may need to configure your node accordingly or use alternative data sources like Blockstream Satellite.

Common reasons to run a node include:
- Avoiding reliance on third parties for transaction validation
- Maintaining transaction privacy by not disclosing wallet transactions to third parties
- Developing Bitcoin software requiring API access to the network
- Building applications that validate transactions according to consensus rules
- Supporting the Bitcoin network by increasing its robustness
