# Bitcoin Core: The Reference Implementation

## Understanding Full Verification Nodes

Full verification nodes are the backbone of the Bitcoin system, providing critical validation of every confirmed transaction against all network rules. They independently verify the integrity of bitcoins to prevent counterfeiting, debasement, and other issues. This verification is crucial because people only accept money if they believe it will retain value for future spending.

Bitcoin Core is the reference implementation used by most full node operators since the network's beginning. It allows users to examine blocks, transactions, and other blockchain data that their node has autonomously verified without relying on any central authority. Running your own node gives you authoritative information about Bitcoin's state not because some entity designates it as such, but because your node independently verifies everything.
