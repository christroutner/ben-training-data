## Risk Diversification Strategies

Just as carrying your entire net worth in cash would be considered reckless, keeping all bitcoins in a single wallet application represents poor security practice. Users should spread risk across multiple diverse Bitcoin storage applications and methods, implementing a tiered approach to bitcoin storage.

A prudent strategy involves keeping only a small percentage (perhaps less than 5%) of bitcoins in online or mobile wallets as "pocket change" for regular transactions. The remainder should be distributed between different storage mechanisms, such as desktop wallets and offline cold storage solutions. This approach ensures that a compromise of any single storage method won't result in catastrophic loss of all funds.
