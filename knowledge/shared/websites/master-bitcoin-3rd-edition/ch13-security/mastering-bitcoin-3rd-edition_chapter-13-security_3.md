## Developing Secure Bitcoin Systems

When developing Bitcoin applications, maintaining decentralization is crucial. Developers familiar with centralized security models might be tempted to apply these to Bitcoin applications, with potentially disastrous results. Bitcoin's security relies on decentralized control over keys and independent transaction validation by users.

Early Bitcoin exchanges demonstrated the dangers of centralization by concentrating user funds in single "hot" wallets with keys stored on a single server. This removed control from users and centralized it in a single system, making them targets for catastrophic hacks. Unless you're prepared to invest heavily in operational security, multiple layers of access control, and audits (as traditional banks do), you should avoid taking funds outside of Bitcoin's decentralized security context.

Even with substantial security investments, centralized architectures ultimately replicate the vulnerable models of traditional financial networks. To leverage Bitcoin's unique security advantages, developers must resist familiar centralized approaches that ultimately undermine Bitcoin's security model.
