# Bitcoin Security: Technical Aspects

## Bitcoin as Digital Cash

Bitcoin is fundamentally different from traditional financial instruments because it functions like digital cash or gold. Possession of the private keys to spend bitcoins is equivalent to physical possession of cash or precious metals. If you lose your keys, misplace them, or have them stolen, you have no recourse within the protocol - similar to dropping cash on a sidewalk.

Unlike physical cash, however, Bitcoin wallets containing your keys can be backed up like any digital file. They can be stored in multiple copies or even printed on paper for hard-copy backup. This unique property requires us to think about securing bitcoins in ways that differ from traditional financial security approaches.
