## Physical Bitcoin Storage

Physical storage offers an effective security method that leverages users' familiarity with physical security. Since Bitcoin keys are simply numbers, they can be converted to physical form by printing on paper or etching on metal plates. This approach is often called "cold storage" - keeping bitcoins offline on systems never connected to the internet.

A seed phrase printed on paper is known as a "paper backup," and many wallets support this feature. After creating such backups, securing the bitcoins becomes a matter of physically securing these documents or objects. This approach eliminates many of the digital attack vectors that threaten online keys, making it particularly effective for long-term storage of significant amounts.
