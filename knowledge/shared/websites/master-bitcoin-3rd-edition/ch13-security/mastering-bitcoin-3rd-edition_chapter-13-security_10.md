## Multisignature Security

For entities or individuals storing large bitcoin amounts, multisignature addresses provide enhanced security by requiring multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. This distributes trust across multiple keys and eliminates single points of failure in the security model.

In corporate environments, signing keys should be generated independently and held by different executives to ensure no single person can compromise the funds. This creates a governance structure around Bitcoin holdings that can prevent both external attacks and internal threats. Multisignature addresses can also offer redundancy, where a single person holds several keys stored in different locations, protecting against the loss or destruction of any single key.
