## Schnorr-based Scriptless Multisignatures

A key advantage of Schnorr signatures is the ability to create scriptless multisignatures. In this scheme, multiple parties can cooperate to create a single signature that proves they collectively know the sum of their private keys, without revealing individual private keys.

The basic protocol works as follows:

1. Participants Alice and Bob each have private keys y and z, respectively
2. They derive public keys yG and zG, then combine them to create an aggregated public key xG = yG + zG
3. Each chooses a private nonce (a for Alice, b for Bob) and derives public nonces aG and bG
4. They produce an aggregated public nonce kG = aG + bG
5. They generate a challenge scalar e = hash(kG || xG || m)
6. Alice computes q = a + ey and Bob computes r = b + ez
7. They combine these to form s = q + r
8. The final signature is (kG, s)

However, this basic protocol is vulnerable to key cancellation attacks, where one party might learn another's public key before committing to their own, potentially allowing them to create a valid signature without the other's participation. Various security measures, like commitment schemes, have been developed to address this issue.

The MuSig family of protocols offers secure implementations:
- MuSig (MuSig1): Simple but requires three rounds of communication
- MuSig2 (BIP327): Requires only two rounds of communication, more efficient
- MuSig-DN: Uses deterministic nonces to eliminate repeated session attacks
