## The Importance of Randomness in Signatures

Both Schnorr and ECDSA signature algorithms use a random number k as a private nonce. The security of these algorithms critically depends on never reusing the same value of k for different messages (transactions) with the same private key. If the same k is used to sign different transactions, the private key can be calculated by anyone, potentially leading to theft of funds.

This vulnerability has resulted in actual thefts in Bitcoin's history due to improperly initialized random-number generators. To mitigate this risk, the industry best practice is to deterministically derive k using both the transaction data and the private key, ensuring each transaction produces a different k value.

For ECDSA, RFC6979 defines the standard algorithm for deterministic initialization of k. For Schnorr signatures, BIP340 recommends a default signing algorithm. These approaches can generate k either entirely deterministically or with additional entropy for extra protection against side-channel attacks.
