## Schnorr-based Scriptless Threshold Signatures

While scriptless multisignatures require all participants (k-of-k) to sign, threshold signatures allow a subset of participants (t-of-k) to sign. Threshold signatures combine the space efficiency and privacy benefits of scriptless multisignatures with the flexibility of allowing a subset of participants to sign.

A simple threshold signature scheme can be implemented by combining scriptless multisignatures with verifiable secret sharing. In this approach:

1. Participants collaborate to create a regular multisignature public key
2. Each participant derives secret shares from their private key
3. Each participant distributes their secret shares to the other participants
4. When a threshold number of participants want to sign, they exchange the shares they possess for the missing participants
5. They can then reconstruct the missing private keys and create a complete multisignature

This approach has some limitations:
- **No accountability**: It's impossible to prove which specific members of the group participated in signing
- **Vulnerability to manipulation attacks**: A dishonest participant could potentially reconstruct multiple private keys by deceiving other participants

Research on scriptless threshold signatures continues, with peer-reviewed solutions expected to become available in the future.
