## Network Composition

The main Bitcoin network consists of about 10,000 listening nodes running various versions of Bitcoin Core and several hundred nodes running alternative implementations like BitcoinJ, btcd, and bcoin. A small percentage of these nodes are mining nodes, with many others functioning as archival full nodes.

These archival nodes maintain full copies of the blockchain without mining or wallet functions, serving as network edge routers. This allows various services like exchanges, wallets, block explorers, and merchant payment processors to be built on top of the Bitcoin network.
