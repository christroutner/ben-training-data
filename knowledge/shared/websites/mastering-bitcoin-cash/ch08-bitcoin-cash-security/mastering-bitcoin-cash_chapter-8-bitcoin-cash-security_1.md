# Bitcoin Cash Security

## Unique Nature of Bitcoin Cash Security
Bitcoin Cash functions as digital cash rather than an abstract value reference. Possession of keys equals full ownership, with no recourse for loss or theft. Unlike physical assets, Bitcoin Cash wallets can be backed up in multiple copies, even printed on paper. This unique combination of cash-like properties with digital capabilities requires novel approaches to security.

The core security principle in Bitcoin Cash is decentralization. Traditional payment systems use access control and encryption to secure networks, while Bitcoin Cash pushes responsibility to users through proof of work. This fundamental difference means Bitcoin Cash transactions don't require network encryptionâ€”they authorize only specific values to specific recipients and cannot be forged or modified.
