## Hardware Wallets
Purpose-built hardware wallets represent the future of Bitcoin Cash security for most users. Unlike general-purpose computers, these devices have a single functionâ€”secure cryptocurrency storage. Their limited interfaces and specialized software significantly reduce potential attack vectors.

Hardware wallets like Trezor provide near-foolproof security even for non-technical users. By physically separating the signing process from potentially compromised computers, these devices ensure private keys never leave the secure environment, even when conducting transactions. As the technology matures, hardware wallets are likely to become the predominant method of Bitcoin Cash storage for security-conscious users.
