## Denominations and Units

The Bitcoin Cash system can transact in fractional values, with the smallest unit being a satoshi, representing 1/100,000,000th of a Bitcoin Cash (0.00000001 BCH). This divisibility allows for microtransactions and precise value transfers.

Other common denominations include:
- milli-bitcoins (0.001 BCH)
- bits (0.000001 BCH)
- satoshis (0.00000001 BCH)

When processing transactions, the system handles these denominations internally, while wallet interfaces typically display balances in the most user-friendly unit based on the amount and context. This flexibility in denominations allows Bitcoin Cash to function both for high-value transfers and small everyday purchases like coffee.
