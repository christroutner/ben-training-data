## Anatomy of Bitcoin Cash Transactions

Transactions are the fundamental building blocks in the Bitcoin Cash system. Each transaction represents a transfer of value between Bitcoin Cash addresses and contains inputs (debits) and outputs (credits). Inputs come from previous transaction outputs, creating a chain of ownership as value moves through the system.

Every transaction includes cryptographic proof of ownership in the form of digital signatures. When a user spends Bitcoin Cash, they sign a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction to a new owner identified by a Bitcoin Cash address. The new owner can then spend these funds by creating another transaction, continuing the chain. The difference between inputs and outputs in a transaction creates an implied transaction fee collected by miners.

Common transaction types include: simple payments with change (one input, two outputs), aggregating transactions that combine multiple inputs into a single output, and distributing transactions that split one input into multiple outputs for different recipients.
