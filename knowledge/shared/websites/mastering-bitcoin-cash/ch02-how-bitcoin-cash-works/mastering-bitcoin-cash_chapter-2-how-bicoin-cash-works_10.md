## Blockchain Explorers

Blockchain explorers are web applications that allow users to search and navigate the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. They provide a user-friendly interface to inspect addresses, transactions, and blocks, making the cryptographic details of the blockchain accessible to users without specialized software.

Popular Bitcoin Cash blockchain explorers include:
- Explorer by Bitcoin.com (https://explorer.bitcoin.com/bch)
- Blockchair (https://blockchair.com/bitcoin-cash/blocks)

These tools allow users to verify transactions, check address balances, and examine block details. Each explorer provides a search function that accepts an address, transaction hash, or block number and displays the corresponding data from the Bitcoin Cash network. Blockchain explorers serve as transparent windows into the otherwise complex cryptographic ledger.
