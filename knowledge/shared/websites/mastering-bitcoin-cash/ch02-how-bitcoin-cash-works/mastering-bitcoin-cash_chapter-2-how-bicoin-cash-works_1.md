# How Bitcoin Cash Works: Technical Overview

## Bitcoin Cash Fundamentals

Bitcoin Cash is a decentralized payment system where trust emerges through interactions between network participants rather than from a central authority. The system consists of users with digital wallets containing cryptographic keys, transactions that propagate across a peer-to-peer network, and miners who produce the blockchain through competitive computation. This blockchain serves as the authoritative ledger of all transactions.

Users interact with the Bitcoin Cash network by creating transactions that transfer value between Bitcoin Cash addresses. These transactions are verified by network nodes, collected into blocks by miners, and permanently recorded on the blockchain. This distributed consensus mechanism is what allows Bitcoin Cash to operate without a central trusted authority.
