## The Mining Process

Mining serves two essential functions in Bitcoin Cash: creating new coins through block rewards and establishing trust by requiring computational work to add transactions to the blockchain. The mining process is competitive, with miners racing to find a solution to a cryptographic puzzle that validates a block of transactions.

The process works similarly to a giant competitive sudoku puzzle that resets approximately every 10 minutes when someone finds a solution. The puzzle is asymmetrically difficultâ€”hard to solve but easy to verify. Miners must repeatedly hash the block header and a random number using the SHA256 algorithm until they find a solution matching a predetermined pattern. The first miner to find a solution publishes the block to the network and claims the block reward.

As Bitcoin Cash has evolved, mining has transitioned from CPU-based mining to specialized hardware. Today, profitable mining typically requires application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed specifically for Bitcoin Cash mining. Many miners join mining pools to combine their computational resources and share rewards proportionally.
