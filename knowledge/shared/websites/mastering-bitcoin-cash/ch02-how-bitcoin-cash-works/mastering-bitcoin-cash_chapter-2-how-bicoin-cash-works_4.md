## Transaction Propagation and Validation

Once constructed, a transaction is transmitted to the Bitcoin Cash network through a peer-to-peer protocol. Any Bitcoin Cash node that receives a valid transaction it hasn't seen before will immediately forward it to other connected nodes. This flooding approach ensures rapid propagation across the entire network, typically reaching most nodes within seconds.

Recipients can verify incoming transactions by checking that they contain outputs redeemable by their keys. They can also independently verify that a transaction is well-formed, uses previously unspent inputs, and includes sufficient fees to be mined in an upcoming block. For small-value transactions (like buying coffee), merchants often accept valid transactions with zero confirmations, as the risk is comparable to accepting credit card payments without ID or signature verification.
