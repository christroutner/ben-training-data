## Private and Public Keys

A private key is simply a random number that serves as the root of user control over Bitcoin Cash funds. It's used to create signatures needed to spend bitcoins and must remain secret and backed up safely. Loss of a private key means permanent loss of associated funds.

Generating a private key requires finding a secure source of entropy (randomness). Bitcoin Cash keys are essentially random numbers between 1 and n-1, where n is a constant (approximately 1.158 × 10^77) defined by the elliptic curve used in Bitcoin Cash. This is typically achieved by feeding random bits into the SHA256 hash algorithm to produce a 256-bit number.

The public key is calculated from the private key using elliptic curve multiplication: K = k × G, where k is the private key, G is a generator point, and K is the resulting public key. This operation is one-way – calculating k from K (known as finding the discrete logarithm) is computationally infeasible, requiring a brute-force search of all possible values.
