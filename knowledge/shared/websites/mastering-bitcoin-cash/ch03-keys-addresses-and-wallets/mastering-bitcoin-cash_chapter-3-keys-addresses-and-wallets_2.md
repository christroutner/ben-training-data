## Fundamentals of Bitcoin Cash Ownership

Ownership in Bitcoin Cash is established through digital keys, addresses, and signatures. Keys are not stored on the Bitcoin Cash network but are maintained by users in a file or database called a wallet. These keys are independent of the Bitcoin Cash protocol and can be generated without an internet connection or access to the blockchain.

Every Bitcoin Cash transaction requires a valid signature generated with private keys, making those keys the control mechanism for funds. Keys come in pairs: a private key (secret) and a public key (shareable). The private key is similar to a PIN or signature on a check, while the public key functions like a bank account number. In most Bitcoin Cash transactions, these keys remain behind the scenes, managed by wallet software.

The recipient's public key is represented by its digital fingerprint – a Bitcoin Cash address – which functions like a beneficiary name on a check. While Bitcoin Cash addresses typically correspond to public keys, they can also represent scripts, making transaction destinations flexible. The Bitcoin Cash address is what users see and share to receive funds.
