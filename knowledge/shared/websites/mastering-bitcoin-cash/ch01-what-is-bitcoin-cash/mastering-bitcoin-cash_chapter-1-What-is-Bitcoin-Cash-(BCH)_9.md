## The Transaction Process

When sending Bitcoin Cash, the process involves creating a transaction that transfers value from the sender's address to the recipient's address. For example, when Joe sends Alice 0.0138 BCH (worth approximately $10 at an exchange rate of $725 per BCH), his wallet creates a transaction assigning that amount to Alice's address.

The transaction is signed with Joe's private keys, authorizing the transfer from his wallet. Once sent, the transaction propagates across the Bitcoin Cash network through the peer-to-peer protocol. Within seconds, most well-connected nodes receive the transaction and recognize Alice's address. The transaction becomes visible immediately in blockchain explorers like explorer.bitcoin.com/bch, where users can look up transactions by entering an address.

Initially, new transactions appear as "Unconfirmed," meaning they've been broadcast to the network but not yet included in the blockchain. For a transaction to be confirmed, it must be included in a block by a miner. Once a new block is created (approximately every 10 minutes), the transactions within it are considered confirmed and the received funds can be spent. This confirmation process is what prevents double-spending and ensures the integrity of the Bitcoin Cash ledger.
