## Acquiring Your First Bitcoin Cash

New users have several methods to acquire their first Bitcoin Cash:

1. **Free BCH Faucet**: Bitcoin.com offers a faucet at free.bitcoin.com where users can receive a small amount of BCH after signing in with a Google account and providing their BCH address.

2. **Cryptocurrency Exchanges**: Platforms like Coinbase allow users to purchase BCH using traditional currency.

3. **Peer-to-Peer Exchange**: Users can buy directly from friends or acquaintances who already own BCH.

4. **Local Marketplaces**: Services like localbitcoincash.org connect buyers with local sellers for in-person cash transactions.

5. **Accepting BCH as Payment**: Users can earn BCH by selling products or services, including professional skills like programming.

6. **Bitcoin Cash ATMs**: Physical ATMs allow users to purchase BCH with cash in many cities, with locations findable through services like coinatmradar.

Each of these methods offers different tradeoffs between convenience, privacy, and accessibility depending on a user's specific circumstances and location.
