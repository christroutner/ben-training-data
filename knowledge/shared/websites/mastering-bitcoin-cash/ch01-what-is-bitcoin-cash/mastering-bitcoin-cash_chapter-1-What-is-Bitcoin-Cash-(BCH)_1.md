# Bitcoin Cash Fundamentals

## What is Bitcoin Cash?

Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that enables digital value transfer among participants through a decentralized network. BCH uses units called bitcoins that are transferred between users primarily over the Internet, though other transport networks can be used. The protocol is implemented as open-source software that can run on various computing devices from laptops to smartphones, making it broadly accessible.

Bitcoin Cash allows users to perform the same functions as conventional currencies: buying and selling goods, sending money, extending credit, etc. Bitcoins can be exchanged for other currencies on specialized exchanges. What makes Bitcoin Cash particularly suited for the Internet is its speed, security, and borderless nature. Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoins are entirely virtual, with ownership proven through cryptographic keys typically stored in digital wallets. Possession of the private key that unlocks a transaction is the only requirement to spend bitcoins.
