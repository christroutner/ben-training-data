## Bitcoin Cash Client Types

To join the Bitcoin Cash network, users need only download an application or use a web application. The reference implementation (originally derived from Satoshi Nakamoto's code) is maintained as an open source project. There are three main types of Bitcoin Cash clients:

1. **Full Client**: Also called a "full node," stores the complete history of all Bitcoin Cash transactions, manages wallets, and can initiate transactions directly on the network. Like a standalone email server, it handles all protocol aspects without relying on third parties.

2. **Lightweight Client**: Stores the user's wallet but depends on third-party servers for access to transactions and the network. Similar to an email client connecting to a mail server, it trusts external servers for transaction validation.

3. **Web Client**: Accessed through a web browser with the wallet stored on third-party servers, similar to webmail services that rely entirely on external infrastructure.

Mobile clients for smartphones can function as full clients, lightweight clients, or web clients. Some mobile clients synchronize with desktop clients to provide a multi-platform wallet experience. The choice of client depends on how much control the user wants over their fundsâ€”full clients offer maximum control but require the user to handle security and backups, while web clients are easier to set up but introduce counterparty risks if the service is compromised.
