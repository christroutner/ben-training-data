# Buy & Sell Tokens

The [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://psfoundation.info) has developed decentralized exchange (DEX) software for buying and selling SLP tokens. Documentation for DEX software can be found at [dex-docs.psfoundation.info](https://dex-docs.psfoundation.info).

The DEX is very different from decentralized exchanges such as on ETH and other EVM chains. There is no liquidity pool. Tokens are offered by a seller, and taken by a buyer. There are only two parties involved. The protocol is *trustless* and *atomic*

In order to sell or purchase tokens, you will need some BCH and a web wallet. There are two versions of the web wallet: one for buyers, and one for sellers.

## Buying Tokens

Anyone can purchase tokens without any account or permission. All you need is some BCH. Buyers are known as *takers*, because they are taking an Offer. The DEX listings can be viewed and purchased by the Taker web wallet:

## Selling Tokens

Selling tokens is a little more complex the buying them. The Seller's software needs to be online in order to finalize a sale. For this reason you will need an account to sell tokens, or you'll need to run your own copy of bch-dex.

Watch the video below for instructions on how to sell tokens on the DEX, and how to request an account for selling tokens on this site:
