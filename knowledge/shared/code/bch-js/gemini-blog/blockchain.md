**Blockchain Interactions with bch-js**

The `Blockchain` module in `bch-js` provides functions to interact with the Bitcoin Cash blockchain, allowing you to retrieve information about blocks, transactions, and UTXOs.

**Accessing Blockchain Data**

Being able to query the blockchain programmatically is crucial for building applications that need to verify transactions, check balances, or explore the history of the chain.

**Key Functions**

* **`getBlockchainInfo()`**: Retrieves general information about the blockchain, such as the current block height, difficulty, and chain.
* **`getBestBlockHash()`**: Gets the hash of the current highest block (the tip of the chain).
* **`getBlock(hash, verbosity = 1)`**: Retrieves information about a specific block, given its hash. The `verbosity` level controls how much detail is returned.
* **`getBlockCount()`**: Gets the total number of blocks in the chain.
* **`getBlockHash(blockHeight)`**: Gets the hash of a block at a specific height.
* **`getChainTips()`**: Provides information about the current chain tips.
* **`getMempoolInfo()`**: Retrieves statistics about the transactions currently in the memory pool.
* **`getMempoolContents()`**: Lists the transaction IDs of transactions in the memory pool.
* **`getRawMempool(verbose = false)`**: Gets the raw transaction IDs from the memory pool. If `verbose` is true, returns complete transaction data.
* **`getTxOut(txid, vout, include_mempool = true)`**: Retrieves information about a specific transaction output (UTXO).
* **`getTxOutProof(txids, blockhash)`**: Generates a Merkle proof that a transaction is included in a block.
* **`verifyTxOutProof(proof)`**: Verifies a Merkle proof.

**Example Use Cases**

* A wallet application might use `getBlockchainInfo()` to display the current block height and network status.
* A block explorer would use many of these functions to provide users with detailed information about blocks and transactions.
