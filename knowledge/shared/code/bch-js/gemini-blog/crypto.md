**Blog Post 7: Exploring the Crypto Module in bch-js**

The `Crypto` module in `bch-js` provides cryptographic functions for working with Bitcoin Cash.

**Cryptography in Bitcoin Cash**

Cryptography is the backbone of Bitcoin Cash, ensuring security through digital signatures, hashing, and random number generation.

**Key Functions**

* **`hash160(buffer)`**: Calculates the RIPEMD160 hash of the SHA256 hash of a buffer. This is used extensively in Bitcoin Cash addresses.
* **`randomBytes(size)`**: Generates cryptographically strong pseudo-random data.

**Importance**

The `Crypto` module provides the building blocks for secure key generation, address creation, and transaction signing.
