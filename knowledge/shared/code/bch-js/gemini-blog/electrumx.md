**ElectrumX Client in bch-js**

The `ElectrumX` module in `bch-js` provides functionality to connect to ElectrumX servers. ElectrumX is an indexing server that makes it faster and easier to query the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.

**Faster Blockchain Queries**

ElectrumX servers maintain an index of the blockchain, allowing for quick retrieval of information like transaction history and UTXO sets.

**Benefits of Using ElectrumX**

* Speed: Faster than querying a full node directly.
* Efficiency: Reduces the load on your own node.

`bch-js` can use ElectrumX to speed up blockchain operations.
