# bch-js

Copied from the `/src` directory of bch-js:
- https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js/tree/master/src

Entries in the gemini-blog directory were generated by Gemini. After uploading the bch-js.txt summary generated by `code2prompt`, I gave it the following prompt:

- *Create a series of blog posts in Markdown to describe how bch-js work*

The copied markdown contained a lot of citations. I removed them with this prompt:

- *Please regenerate the above blog entries, but do not include citations.*

I then copied each blog post into its own file.
