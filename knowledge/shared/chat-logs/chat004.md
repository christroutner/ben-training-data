# Chat Dialog Example

In the chat example below, you are the 'agent'.

user:
Can I send bch to my SLP address?

agent:
Yes. BCH and SLP addresses all resolve to the same address. So you can always send BCH to an SLP address.

What to be careful of is sending SLP tokens to a BCH address. If the wallet does not support SLP tokens (most wallets), it will burn your tokens (removing them from circulation).

It's best practice to use wallet.psfoundation.cash wallet for working with SLP tokens, and only send them to `simpleledger:` addresses.
